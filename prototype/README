Project: Scheduler Tool

Make Instructions:

Simply typing "make" will compile all necessary java files and run them. For
our demonstration, our team chose to illustrate our GUI via a free-floating,
top-level menu bar. Thus, upon typing "make", this menu bar will be displayed,
along with the "Administrator" splash screen. Also, simply typing "make"
will clean out all "*.class" files after the program is closed. 

Please note the following features are the only ones which "do" anything. 
Everything else will, at best, display something to the terminal. 

   UI Admin Splash
   File->Exit
   View->[Course/Instructor/Location/Conflict]
   Schedule->Instructor
   Schedule->Instructor->Add
   Schedule->Preferences
   Schedule->Quality
   Prototype->[Calendar View/Manual Edit]

Also, please be aware that clicking the "X" button to close a window may
inadvertantly close the entire program, no matter what window it was. This is
buggy behavior, but we were unable to remedy it before the deadline. If this
happenes, simply type "make run" to restart the program. 

If you wish to compile and run the java files in different steps, "make gui"
and "make run" will suffice, respectively. "make clean" will delete all 
"*.class" files. 

NOTE: The "Prototype" menu will not be in an actual release. It has been 
      placed to illustrate functionality which would normally open immediately
      when Scheduler Tool is opened. However, to make viewing the prototype
      easier, it has been wrapped up into the "Prototype" menu.

Eric Liebowitz         #1  The menu bar containing the "File", "Edit", "View",
                           "Schedule", "Prototype", and "Help" menus opened 
                           at startup
                       #2  The splash screen opened at startup
                       #3  Select File-->Exit

                       (NOTE: Though I only have 3 GUI's, the top-level menu
                       bar linked everyone elses GUI's together, which took
                       a significant amount of effort and coordination. I also
                       created and debugged the Makefile associate with
                       compilation)
