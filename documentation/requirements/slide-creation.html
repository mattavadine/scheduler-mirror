<strong>Walkthru Slide Creation</strong>

</p>
<br>
<br>
The following are the steps necessary to generate a slide in the requirements
walk-thru.  There are three files involved in the slide creation process.  For
explanation purposes here, the slides will have the same root filename
"<tt>X</tt>".  The files are the following:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>requirements/mockups/UID/X.html</tt> -- the hand-built HTML file that is
the screen image to be shown in a slide
<li>
<tt>requirements/images/X.png</tt> -- the image captured from the mockup
<tt>X.html</tt> file
<li>
<tt>requirements/walkthru/X.html</tt> -- the slide as it appears in the
walkthru; this <tt>X.html</tt> has the navigation links, explanatory blurb, and
links to the slide screen image in <tt>images/X.png</tt>
</ul>
</p><p>
As of 17oct11, there is no consistent naming convention for these three files.
The naming convention followed here is to use the same root file name for all
of them.
</p><p>
Here are the specific steps to create these files:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Create or edit the HTML file in <tt>requirements/mockups/UID/X.html</tt>, where
UID is your user id.  By convention, mockup HTML files are stored in
subdirectories named with user id.  Again, "X" is the root name of the slide
file we're creating or editing.  <tt>X.html</tt> in the mockup directory is the
raw HTML image content for a slide.
<p> <li>
Goto the <tt>requirements/mockups/HTML\ Template</tt> directory.
<p> <li>
Copy the entire Tempus\ Layout_files subdirectory and the <tt>Tempus\
Layout.html</tt> file to a working dir, and go to that working directory.
<p> <li>
A quick way to "install" <tt>X.html</tt> into the Tempus Layout is to rename
<tt>X.html</tt> to <tt>samplePage.html</tt>.  The <tt>samplePage</tt> file is
the name that is src included in <tt>Tempus\ Layout.html</tt>.  Alternatively,
the included file name in <tt>Tempus\ Layout.html</tt> can be changed to
<tt>X.html</tt>.
<p> <li>
Open <tt>Tempus\ Layout.html</tt> in a Chrome browser, ignoring the Web Toolkit
error message.  As of 17oct11, using Chrome is necessary since Firefox has
problems with sizing, and Safari has problems with fonts in the template.
<p> <li>
Capture the screen image displayed in the browser as a png and store in
<tt>X.png</tt>.  Copy or move <tt>X.png</tt> from your working directory into
<tt>requirements/images</tt>.
<p> <li>
To create the actual slide, copy <tt>requirements/walkthru/template.html</tt>
into <tt>requirements/walkthru/X.html</tt>.
<p> <li>
Edit the content of the slide file as follows:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Make the Next and Prev links point to the proper slides.
<p> <li>
Link to the captured image in <tt>images/X.png</tt>.
<p> <li>
Write the blurb.
<p> <li>
Fix the title.
