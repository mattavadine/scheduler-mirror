The following is a description of the subdirectories of this website directory.

The 'content' subdirectory has HTML files for each of the project website
pages.  The HTML content is what appears in the right middle frame of a
WARC-layout web page.  The 'content' subdirectory also has groff files of the
same root filenames as the HTML files.  The HTML files are generated from the
groff files in the build script named .make.csh.

The 'dreamweaver' subdirectory has HTML wrapper files.  These files contain
all of the WARC-created foo-foo, plus UNIX '.so' commands to include the
content.  The content is included using the standard UNIX 'soelim' command,
which is run in the build script ../content/.make.csh.

There's another 'dreamweaver-samples' subdirectory that has as-is WARC samples
The two dreaamwearver subdirectories are used to separate the actual website
content from the Poly samples.  These need to be separated because when
Dreamweaver goes to apply a template, it does a recursive directory search for
all .dwt files.  We don't want to change the sample .dwts when we change the
scheduler website, so the samples are put in the sibling suffixed directory
named "dreamweaver-samples".  Since we're not using Dreamweaver at this point,
this separation is moot, but it's left in place in case we do return to
Dreamweaver at some point, however unlikely that may be.  If we do go back to
Dreamweaver, the HTML content files can be physically placed back into the
dreamweaver files, where the corresponding .so commands are.
