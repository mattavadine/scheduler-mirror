The following is a description of the subdirectories of this website directory.

The content subdirectory has HTML files for each of the project website pages.
This content is included in the Dreamweaver files by having symbolic links from
the dreamweaver/Library to content/*.html.  Things are done this way in case we
want to abandon Dreamweaver at some point.  If we do this, we'll have clean
HTML content files that we can use in some other HTML editor, or edit by hand.

There are two dreamweaver subdirectories, one with the "-samples" suffix, the
other without the suffix.  These two subdirectories are used to separate the
actual website content from the Poly samples.  These need to be separated
because when dreamweaver goes to apply a template, it does a recursive
directory search for all .dwt files.  We don't want to change the sample .dwts
when we change the scheduler website, so the samples are put in the sibling
suffixed directory named "dreamweaver-samples".

So far, I've found Dreamweaver to be way more trouble than it's worth.  I'm
sticking with it for now, in case its benefits become apparent at some future
date.  If this doesn't happen soon, I'll be happy to go with hand editing or
some other HTML editor.
