<h1>
Development
</h1>
<p>
This page of the website is the entry point for project developers.  Since
development has not yet begun, this page is at present a place holder.
<p>
Non-developers are free to browse this part of the project, but much of the
content may not be of interest to non-technical stakeholders.  The important
point is that the project will be entirely open-source. Any interested party
may view any and all aspects of project development as it proceeds.
<p>
The sample projects linked on the
<a href="examples.html">
Examples
</a>
page show a standard development organization.  This organization, or one very
much like it will be used for the development of this year's scheduler project:
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>requirements</em></strong> -- user-level functional requirements
for the project
<li>
<strong><em>specification</em></strong> -- formal specification of the
functional requirements
<li>
<strong><em>prototype</em></strong> -- operational prototype, with limited
functionality
<li>
<strong><em>design</em></strong> -- architectural software design
<li>
<strong><em>implementation</em></strong> -- implementation source and
executables
<li>
<strong><em>testing</em></strong> -- testing plans and results
<li>
<strong><em>administration</em></strong> -- administrative and managerial
information
<li>
<strong><em>documentation</em></strong> -- audience-specific documentation,
such as website content and end-user help documentation
</ul>
