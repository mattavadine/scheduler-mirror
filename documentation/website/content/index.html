Introduction
</h1>
<p>
The objective of the scheduler project is to build a software tool to help
academic departments with course scheduling.  Some of the features we envision
for the tool are the following:
<ul>
<li>
an easy-to-use database of instructor information, which includes course
teaching preferences and teaching time preferences
<li>
an easy-to-use database of a department's course offerings, including courses
planned for particular quarters
<li>
the ability to define department-specific scheduling constraints to guide the
scheduling process
<li>
a sophisticated scheduling algorithm that generates an optimized schedule,
based on instructor preferences, planned course offerings, and departmental
constraints
<li>
the ability to fine tune a generated schedule, with automated checking to
ensure schedule completeness and consistency
</ul>
</p><p>
We envision the tool being used at the department level, by the same people who
normally perform department scheduling now.  The result of a scheduling session
will be in a form suitable for electronic submission to the campus scheduling
database.  Qualitatively, we seek to generate a schedule that is complete,
consistent with faculty preferences, consistent with departmental constraints,
and fair to a department's faculty overall.

<h2>
A Brief History
</h2>
<p>
Achieving the objectives outlined above could be an ambitious undertaking.  An
advantage we have in our efforts is a history of working on course scheduling
projects.  Specifically, versions of the scheduling tool have been assigned as
two-quarter class projects in undergraduate software engineering courses for a
number of years.  In addition, there have been several senior projects that
have refined key scheduling functionality, including the scheduling algorithm
and schedule database management.  The results of these past efforts provide a
solid base on which to work.  The

<h2>
What's New this Year
</h2>
<p>
As many academics know, it is difficult to achieve production-quality work from
student class projects, even senior projects.  This year's work on the
scheduling project will be conducted in a new course setting -- the Computer
Science Department's <em>software engineering capstone course</em>.  The
primary goal for the capstone is to produce software that can be deployed in an
actual operational setting.
</p><p>
Using the student work so far as a basis, we believe that a production-quality
scheduling tool is an achievable goal in the coming year.  To be sure, there
will be many technical and organizational challenges.  The other pages of this
website provide an introduction to how we plan to meet the challenges.
