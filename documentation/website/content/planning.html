<h1>
Planning
</h1>
<p>
A year-long software project will involve a considerable amount of planning.
We will do this planning in a step-by-step fashion.  Along the way, we will do
our utmost to tailor the plans to meet the specific needs of different
stakeholders.
</p><p>
Three particular aspects of planning are important at the beginning of the
project:
<ul>
<li>
what to expect in the initial requirements interview
<li>
how we plan to communicate among project stakeholders
<li>
what kind of time commitment may be involved
</ul>
</p><p>
The next three sections of this planning page are directed specifically at
department schedulers.  The "you" in the discussion refers to "you, the
department scheduler".
</p>

<a name="initial-interview">
<h2>
The Initial Requirements Interview
</h2>
</a>
<p>
The purpose of the initial requirements interview is to gather information in
the following areas:
<ul>
<li>
identify the people involved with scheduling in your department
<li>
get an overview of how scheduling is performed at present, including what forms
of software tools are used
<li>
ask about any ideas you may have for features in a scheduling software tool
<li>
determine if there are any particular positive or negative impacts that may
arise with the introduction of new scheduling software in your department
<li>
gather any other information you may wish to provide
</ul>
</p><p>
You may already have some or all of this information in document form, online
or on paper.  If so, you can expedite the interview process by providing a
brief overview of your documented material during the interview.  Then you can
provide the links or paper copies to the interview team, for review by them
after the interview is over.
</p><p>
The interview will be scheduled to last 30 minutes.  If you think you may have
more to discuss than can be covered in 30 minutes, please feel free to request
a longer time period, up to an hour.  This scheduling detail will be taken care
of when a student interview team makes its initial email contact with you
during the first week of classes.
</p><p>
If you would like further details of how the interview will be conducted, you
can read the script that the students will follow, at:

Communications Planning
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Our objective is to maximize communication efficiency for everyone.  As
outlined in the
<a href="people.html">
People
</a>
section, there are three primarily forms of communication:
<ul>
<li>
in-person
<li>
email
<li>
webpage and wiki
</ul>
</p><p>
With everyone's busy schedule, in-person communication will be considered a
particularly valuable resource.  If anyone wants to talk in person with project
developers, we have adequate student staff to accommodate this.  However, we
expect that most communication will happen electronically.
</p><p>
Email is an efficient means to send mass mailings of interest to all
stakeholders.  However, it clearly has its shortcomings in a number of areas,
as most of us are well aware.  Once the project is underway, most communication
from the developers will be in the form of postings on the project website.
</p><p>
From the perspective of non-developer stakeholders, there are two forms of
website communication -- passive and active.  Passive communication is simply a
matter of reading the website, at your convenience.  Active website
communication will involve using the website's wiki, some introductory details
of which are covered in the
<a href="wiki.html">
Wiki
</a>
section.
</p><p>
An important aspect of communication planning is determining how much of it
everyone wants to do.  For non-developers, there are roughly these three
levels:
<ul>
<li>
little or no active communication beyond the initial interview, with as much
reading of the web page as desired
<li>
active communication via the project wiki, email, or in-person meetings
<li>
active participation in reviewing the product prototype as it is developed
throughout the quarter; more details on this communication level will come a
bit later in the quarter
</ul>
</p><p>
Determining which of these communication levels is right for you is entirely
your choice.  If you find using a wiki is a convenient way to communicate,
that's splendid.  If you'd rather send an email or talk in person, that's fine
too.  You do not have to use the wiki to be a fully participating stakeholder.
If you have little time to participate actively, then you can read the project
website as you have time, to keep abreast of developments.
</p>

<a name="time-commitment">
<h2>
Estimated Time Commitment
</h2>
</a>
<p>
The involvement of end users is one of the most important factors for success
in a software project.  Alas, such involvement requires a time investment
during the early stages of product development.
</p><p>
Ideally, we would like three additional hours of your time, beyond the initial
interview.  This will be divided into approximately one hour segments in each
of weeks 4, 7, and 10 of the Fall quarter.  The time will be spent reviewing
what the project team comes up with to meet your requirements for scheduling
software.
</p><p>
If the scheduler project produces a product that is useful to you, the time you
invest during product development will be more than offset by the time that you
save in future scheduling work.
