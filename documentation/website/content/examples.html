This page has links to selected examples of past student projects.  The project
links point to full project repositories.  The project aspect of most immediate
interest is the requirements.  You can get to the requirements for each project
by following the project link, and then following the
<strong>requirements</strong> link.
<p>
Here are some noteworthy observations about the example projects:
<ul>
<li>
The primary focus of all past scheduler projects has been on scheduling
requirements for the Computer Science department.  Insofar as these
requirements are similar to other departments, these projects offer some
interesting ideas.  A major focus for this year's work is to expand the focus
from solely computer science scheduling, to other departments on campus.
<li>
The examples show a mix of user interface styles.  Some are desktop
applications, others are web-based interfaces.  An important aspect of software
requirements analysis is not to get bogged down too early in user interface
details.  This will be a recurring theme in the early stages of this year's
efforts.
<li>
There is notable similarity in the functional aspects of all the projects.
This is due to recurring focus on requirements for the computer science
department, as well as built-in biases from the course instructor.  Everyone
associated with this year's project will be admonished to put aside any biases
during the requirements gathering phase, so that we can understand requirements
from the potentially differing perspectives of departments across campus.
