The notes here are based on the version of the alpha release on the website as
of 11 May.  It looks like a bunch of the suggestions in the 27 April comments
aren't done yet, so I don't know if I was looking at the most recent version
(it says 7may10 on the website link).
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>
<strong>Changes to the menubar:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<li>
Change the name of the 'Database' menu to 'Databases'.
<li>
The item names in the 'Schedule' and 'Databases' menus should match, i.e., make
the 'Schedule' items plural.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
<strong>Changes to the 'Schedule' menu:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<li>
Items b and d in the

27 April comments
</a>
still need to get done.
<li>
This should happen before the demo.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
<strong>Database dialogs</strong>
<ol type=a>
<li>
Most of the Database items in the 27 April notes still need to get done.  These
are items 3a thorough 3i and item 4a.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
<strong>General UI features:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<li>
All of the lists in the various dialogs should have labels on the top of them,
in particular the lists in the DB dialogs and the all-in-one schedule dialog.
<li>
You can narrow some of the display columns to make the wider displays fit on a
narrowish screen.  In particular,
<ul>
<li>
the first four columns in the Schedule display
<li>
the Bldb/Room and Preferences panes in the all-in-one schedule display ("Bldb"
should be "Bldg")
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
<strong>For the Demo</strong>
<P>
It's time to do this with Diane, to get some feed-back from her.  I think the
best thing to do at this point is to be with her when you give the initial
demo.  Then if she's willing, she can play around with it some more on her own.
For the self-guided part, you need to update the howToRunDemo to be consistent
with the latest UI.
<p>
As a demo starting point, I think it would be very helpful to have a
'File->New' dialog available.  I think this is the place that someone like
Diane will look first to start things off.  The Open and Save items don't need
to work.  See
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/309/specs/scheduler-f07-afternoon/requirements/2.3-Basic-Schedule-Gen.html">

for the contents of the File New dialog.
