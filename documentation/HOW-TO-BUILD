To create a new deployment named DEPT, login to the VM and do this:

   (1) open the file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   (2) add this

       location /DEPT/ {
	    proxy_pass	http://127.0.0.1:8080;
	}

      at the end of the list of existing lines of this form
    (3) sudo service nginx reload
    (4) add DEPT to the list of departments in implmentation/fabfile.py;
        note that this will also do an 'x' suffixed version, i.e. DEPTx

To do a deployment, login to a mahchine that has ant, fab, and a checked out
copy if the scheduler project; do this:

   (1) cd to the scheduler project directory
   (2) svn update
   (3) cd implementation
   (4) fab build
   (5) fab deploy:dir-name        e.g., fab deploy:CSC,IME; or fab deply:all
						or fac delpoly:all-dev
						or fac delpoly:all-stable
   (6) when prompted, enter your password on the scheduler vm, followed by two
       presses of the Return key

  These steps should culminate with the messages:
    Done.
    Disconnecting from scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu... done.


To validate conditions on the VM, do this:

   (1) service tomcat6 status, which should report something like this:
        * Tomcat servlet engine is running with pid XXXXX
   (2) cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
   (3) ls -sal DEPT


To build and run tests:

   (1) cd ~/work/scheduler-vm/implementation
   (2) fab test:scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu


To add new jUnit tests, goto implementation/build.xml and add a new suite after
this line:
      <test name="scheduler.model.ModelTestSuite" />


To add new Selenium tests: ... (see Evan's message)

  The catalina.out file is a global log.  Each file starting "localhost..." is
  a daily log.  At this point, James does not know precisely the content
  difference between the global and local files.
