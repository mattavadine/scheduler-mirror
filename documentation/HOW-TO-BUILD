To do a deployment, login to a mahchine that has ant, fab, and a checked out
copy if the scheduler project; do this:

   (1) cd to the scheduler project directory

   (2) svn update

   (3) cd implementation

   (4) fab build

   (5) fab deploy:dir-name
         where dir-name is the name of a department site, a comma-separated
         list of department sites, 'all' for all sites, 'all-dev' for all X
         sites, 'all-stable' for all non-X sites
         for example:
             fab deploy:CSCx            -- deploy to CSCx site
             fab deploy:CSCx,IMEx       -- deploy to CSCx and IMEx sites
             fab deploy:all             -- sites
             fab deploy:all-dev         -- all sites with 'x' suffix
             fac delpoly:all-stable     -- all sites without 'x' suffix

   (6) when prompted, enter your password on the scheduler vm, followed by two
       presses of the Return key

  These steps should culminate with the messages:
    Done.
    Disconnecting from scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu... done.

  Note that the fab deploy does NOT automatically delete the serialized
  resource data file.  To this, delete the file

        /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/DEPT/DatabaseState.javaser

  for the deployed DEPT site or sites


To validate conditions on the VM, do this:

   (1) service tomcat6 status, which should report something like this:
        * Tomcat servlet engine is running with pid XXXXX

   (2) cd /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps

   (3) ls -sal DEPT


To view the tomat log, go here:
    /var/log/tomcat6

  The catalina.out file is a global log.  Each file starting "localhost..." is
  a daily log.  At this point, James does not know precisely the content
  difference between the global and local files.


To create a new deployment named DEPT, login to the VM and do this:

   (1) open the file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

   (2) add this

       location /DEPT/ {
            proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        }

      at the end of the list of existing lines of this form

    (3) sudo service nginx reload

    (4) add DEPT to the list of departments in implmentation/fabfile.py;
        note that this will also do an 'x' suffixed version, i.e. DEPTx


To build and run tests:

   (1) cd ~/work/scheduler-vm/implementation

   (2) fab test:scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu


To add new jUnit tests, goto implementation/build.xml and add a new suite after
this line:
      <test name="scheduler.model.ModelTestSuite" />
