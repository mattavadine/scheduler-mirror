<p>
The following table details projected milestones which are to be completed 
during the Spring quarter of 2010. These milestones represent goals for our 
work, and may often yield a demo of our program to display new/improved
functionality.

         A simple "Things to Run" html file to detail the aspects of our program
         which are functional and able to test. This version of program could be
         classified as an "alpha" release, and is intended to demonstrate what 
         our program will be able to do. The program should be runnable via the 
         command line argument "java -jar scheduler.jar".<br>
         <br>
         In particular, any error message that would have simply printed to a 
         console will be routed to a dialog to be displayed to the user.<br>
         <br>
         By the end of this week, a virtual machine will be installed via the 
         Computer Science department. This will become the permanent resident
         of our project repository. Furthermore, our SQL database will be run
         from this server. The program's original specification documents will
         also be placed here, and will available to the general public. (A url
         to link to this will be provided at a later date).

         All things related to the virtual machine will be stable (the database,
         repository, and SQL database).<br>
         <br>
         Project's package structure will be reorganized/structured to more 
         adequately accomadate the team's needs.<br>
         <br>
         A new GUI for creating Schedule Preferences will be drafted and 
         displayed. In particular, the functionality described in the 
         specification documents will be largely trashed, in favor of a more
         rigidly defined, concrete specification whose implementation will
         be feasible by the end of the quarter.<br>
         <br>
         The "generate" package will be broken. In particular, the algorithm
         which generates schedules will be redesigned to accomodate pre-existing
         schedules. The algorithm will also be overhauled to weed out bugs in
         generation. This process will be a long one: it will span multiple
         milestones.<br>
         <br>
         Ideas for how best to implement manual editing/locking will be brought
         up in the weekly, team-advisor meeting.<br>
         <br>
         The ability to specify a professor's time preferences will be 
         implemented.

         Barring continued work on the scheduling algorithm, the "schedule 
         fairness" algorithm will be refined and finalized.<br>
         <br>
         Schedule preferences will have an agreed upon GUI and guaranteed
         functionality. Development on the algorithm to compute a schedule's 
         "quality" will begin.<br>
         <br>
         The ability to manually edit the time, location, and instructor for
         a given course will be functional. Checks for whether manual edits
         create conflicts will <b>not yet be implemented</b>. The ability to
         "lock" schedule items will also be implemented, but perfect 
         functionality will not yet be guaranteed.<br>
         <br>
         Excluding the incorporation of manual edits, the scheduling algorithm
         will have taken shape. In particular, it should not generate conflicts
         (double booking professors/rooms), and should take instructor's 
         time and course preferences into consideration.<br>

         A user will have the ability to open a new schedule (thus downloading
         fresh information from our SQL database), or to open a pre-existing
         schedule. Thus, a user will also be able to save a schedule to their
         computer.<br>
         <br>
         Manual edits which cause conflicts will be highlighted in some way 
         to notify the user. A differentiation will be made between conflicts
         which represent a physical impossibility (i.e. double booking a room) 
         andconflicts created by violating a schedule preference 
         (i.e. overlapping certain courses)<br>
