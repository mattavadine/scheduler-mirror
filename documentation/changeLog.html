<ul>
   <li>
      Added a "TBA" item under "Schedule" menu. When a generated schedule has
      any TBA's, this will display them.
   </li>
   <li>
      Local databases seem to be working. However, it looks like they're just 
      shallow copies of the global ones. This'll need to be resolved in the 
      future.
   </li>
   <li>
      Generate algorithm improved/updated. Time/location decisions are better. 
      In the future, the "DaysForClasses" object will not be chosen during 
      generation. Instead, each course will carry a preference for what doays
      it is to be taught. However, this is not yet implemented. 
   </li>
   <li>
      Saving and opening Schedule data files (".sbf") is now supported. 
      Currently, all you can do is save and open generated schedules (which is
      still pretty cool). Windows automatically update when the new file is
      opened. <cr>
      <cr>
      The ".sbf" extension is purely a convention...it'd be 
      best to stick with it to avoid confusion, if nothing else.

<ul>
   <li>
      Gui look-and-feel updated
   </li>
   <li>
      Dialogs spawn in appropriate places relative to the menubar
   </li>
   <li>
      Menubar spawns conveniently
   </li>
   <li>
      Menubar rearranged and redesigned. Old "Schedule" menu item is now 
      "Database", and it accesses our database directly. The new "Schedule"
      menu item is related to all things about the local schedule. 
   </li>
   <li>
      "Schedule-->Generate" has become "Schedule-->All-in-one"
   </li>
</ul>
