Earlier this academic year, you participated in requirements
interviews for our course scheduling project.  We very much appreciate
your assistance.

The student team working on the project has produced a web-based
program that they would like to demonstrate to prospective users.  If
you are interested in a demonstration sometime in the next couple
weeks, please reply and we will set up a convenient meeting time and
place.

Thank you very much,
     Gene Fisher
     on behalf of the scheduling project team
