         When running coverage tests with Cobertura, it is often the case that
         useless lines (ending braces, opening braces, the second line of a 
         statement which spanned more than one line, <i>comments</i>) are 
         flagged as "not covered". Obviously (like with comments), it is 
         impossible to ever cover these case. However, as such, Cobertura will
         not always give "100%" reports, even if all the code is covered.

         The "<tt>EndBeforeStartException</tt>" catch in "<tt>testing/
         implemenation/source/java/scheduler/generate/ScheduleTest.java</tt>
         (lines 294-296 and 326-329) are marked as not covered. This was done
         intentionally, as the test to be sure that "<tt>DayAvail</tt>" class 
         will throw an "<tt>EndBeforeStartException</tt>" exception is already 
         tested in "<tt>DayAvailTest.java</tt>".

         The Scheduler project can be run with a command line argument to 
         connect to a server. For example:
         
         java -jar scheduler.jar mysql://cedders.homelinux.net/jseallfilled

         Without a command line argument, the program will default to Cedric's
         test server.

         Quality is not yet implemented beause it requires instructor preferences
         which do not exist yet. A basic UI for it is implemented and a rough
         structure for computing the values exist, but neither are possible to
         make any more precise at this point. Fairness, however, is mostly
         functional.

         Unfortunately, the Generate function still has some nasty bugs floating
         around in it. While professors/locations cannot be double booked, the
         algorith still tries to do it (and fails). However, other bugs have 
         made themselves apparent now, such as odd section counts and professors
         not being given labs when they are given lectures.

         Unfortunately, the CalendarViewTest throws an exception because it can't not find the CalendarView.class. I ran make under source/java and it still did not work.
