Currently, this will not be integrated into the scheduler itself, but will instead act as an independent piece of software.

         For this quarter's implementation of the scheduler, schedule 
         preferences will not be incorporated into schedule generation. While
         a user will be able to add/edit/remove such preferences, they will have
         no bearing on a generate schedule. Furthermore, when selecting fields
         to incorporate in generation, the list of schedule preferences will
         not be present

         When specifying course preferences, instructors will not be allowed 
         to give a preference for teaching those lab courses which are 
         paired w/ lectures. Since a professor who is given a lecture which 
         has a lab will be automatically given that lab, specifying a preference
         is meaningless.

         When giving a coure a "lab pairing", a warning will appear if the 
         current number of sections and max enrollment of both the lecture and
         lab are such that it will not be possible for all students in the 
         lecture course to attend the lab. However, this will be nothing more
         than a warning. It will be up to the administrator to remedy this
         problem.

         Current fairness equation is: [sum of (10-instructor preference to teach 
         a class or time)]/(total classes and times assigned in schedule). High
         values mean the instructor was unfairly given many classes they did not
         want, while low values mean the instructor was given a schedule that more
         closely matched his/her class and time specifications.
