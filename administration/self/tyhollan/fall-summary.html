-Restructured the MYSQL databases into a more usable form that also links more directly with the model classes.<p>
-Created an abstract database class that all current and future java "database" classes can use to get most functionality they would need right out of the box.<p>
-Cleaned up SQLDB.java significantly to have more generic functions and safer SQL strings.<p>
-Cleaned up all database files to use string constants instead of hard coded words to reduce errors.<p>
-Moved all data over to a new MYSQL database<p>
-Added methods as needed to the database objects.<p>
-Enabled data copying from an example schedule when a new user is created.<p>
