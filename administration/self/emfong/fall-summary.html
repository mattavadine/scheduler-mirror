<ul>
<li>I organized the usability testing for the class.</li>
<ul>
	<li>I organized using laptops and actually getting the usability lab usable.
	<li>I designed the tests the students took to get us information.
	<li>I researched multiple pieces of software and found the right software that worked on the given equipment.</li>
	<li>I compiled a usability report which summarized the findings of the test.</li>
</ul>
<li>I investigated different usable options for button sizes and button types. The prototype team used acceptable UI elements.</li>
<li>I went on a single client interview.</li>
<li>I worked with the prototype and requirements team to encourage simple design. Unfortunately, ideas and additional requirements quickly spiraled past my experience, and I felt I could not contribute more.</li>
