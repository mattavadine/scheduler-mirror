<p class="p1">CSC 402 (Capstone) Self Evaluation for Salome Navarrete</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Went on two interviews (first round and final round) to obtain information on how scheduling is currently done, and to demonstrate the prototype and get feedback. Includes information on a time preference attribute requirement of University Scheduling being added to Courses, which will affect aspects of the model, view, and requirements.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Learned how model works. Planning with Eric and Evan to seed the model with errors, to test percentage of found detects and estimate undiscovered defects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Became familiar with GWT (first time user), Selenium WebDriver API (Programmatic testing of product through the UI) and GWTTestCase (a hook into Junit's test case for testing GWT application functionality silently, without the UI)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Testing code:</p>
<p class="p1">Implemented GWTTests/SmokeTestSuite, SelectSchedTest and LoginTest files (to be committed)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Implemented TestFramework/Courses, Instructors, Locations, LoginSelectSched, Toolbar, SchedulerBot (to be committed upon finishing update to element selection code)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Implemented/Added element IDs to elements within the Prototype for access by testing mechanisms</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
