<p>
In order to create the class files in the testing directory, navigate to the 
directory <tt>testing/implementation/source/java</tt> and type <tt>make</tt>.
Then, navigate to <tt>testing/implementation/executables/JVM</tt>. Once in that
directory, any one of the following commands may be issued from the command line
to run appropriate tests. 
</p>
<p>
The results of each test are stored in the "<tt>testing/implementation/
executables/JVM/testResults/</tt>" directory. In particular, the name of each 
file's test result file corresponds to the name of the test file 
used to run the test in the first place, sans the "<tt>.java</tt>" extension. 
Thus, the results for the "<tt>AdmintTest.java</tt>" tests would be in a file 
named "<tt>Admin</tt>"

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b><u>How to Run Coverage Tests</u></b></font></p>
<p>
We used the coverage tool "Cobertura". In order to run our coverage tests, first
navigate to <tt>testing/implementation/source/java</tt> and type <tt>make</tt>.
Then, navigate to <tt>testing/implementation/executables/JVM</tt>. From here, in
order to run coverage tests on those classes/methods which were to be tested,
take any one of tests detailed in the list above and prepend it with the prefix
<tt>cv_</tt>. Thus, to run the <tt>AdmintTest.java</tt> file with the coverage
tool, one would type <tt>make cv_admin</tt>

Note: A set method in ViewMode.java and another set method in ViewLevel.java
      do not receive code coverage because they would require a working
      observer which is hard to set up for testing.
