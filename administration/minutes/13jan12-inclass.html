We discussed a few important issues of requirements related to course numbering
and lecture/lab association.  The following decisions were made:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The course number will be represented as a string instead of an integer.
<p> <li>
A schedule item can be lecture, a lab associated with a course (aka, tethered),
or a lab not associated with a course (aka, untethered).
<p> <li>
In the UI, a course will have a list of zero or more labs associated with it,
and a lab will have zero or one course with which it is associated.  The
lecture/lab associations are viewable in both directions in the UI.  That is,
the user can see (a) what labs are associated with a course, and (b) the course
with which a lab is associated.  As is currently the case, courses do not need
to have any associated labs.  Adam had a specific idea for showing the
lecture/lab association as an indented list of labs below each course that has
labs.  This idea was viewed favorably by everyone.
</ol>

We discussed some additional ideas for the way the user interface will be
updated to support these decisions, as well as how these decisions will affect
the scheduling algorithm and data model.  Kaylene and Evan are going to do some
mock ups of interface ideas.  Adam and Salome are going to study the algorithm
and data model.  We will resume discussion in class during week 3.
