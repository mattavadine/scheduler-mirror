Kaylene continued presenting the latest UI ideas from her and Evan.  She took
notes on the storyboard posters as she made the presentation.

<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The team agreed to add a left-most column of row numbers in the resource
editing UIs, that operate as they do in Excel and Numbers.  To whit:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
clicking on the row number highlights the row with a darkened boarder and/or a
very light blue background
<p> <li>
clicking one row then shift-clicking another row inclusively mutli-selects all
rows between the initial click and the shift click
</ol>
<p> <li>
The 'Sched Generate' UI has the following components:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
one scrollable 'Course List' on the left; the scrolling is only vertical; this
list is in a UI <em>drawer</em> that can be opened and closed
<p> <li>
an independently scrollable calendar view on the right; the scrolling is both
vertical and horizontal
<p> <li>
a permanent button row on the bottom with 'Generate' and 'Publish' buttons;
permanent means that this button row is always visible and does not scroll with
the list or calendar panels
</ol>
<p> <li>
Details of preference gathering and instructor UI are postponed to next week.
