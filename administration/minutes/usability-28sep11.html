<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Franz wants help with:
<ul>
<li>
Kinds of devices and tools should we get? E.g., eye trackers, with heat map
creation.  They cost $40K, so we can have a CPE student
<li>
Software.  Look at Morae, $1000 academic license, or similar software.  See
what's available open source.
<li>
Blog about the usability
</ul>

<li>
Layout of Ulab:
<ul>
<li>
Franz explained that the observer room will be layed out similar to the layout
of 256.
<li>
He mentioned 3 possible configs of observee room:
<blockquote>
   (1) use computers
<br>
   (2) mobile usability evals
<br>
   (3) games, e.g., MS XBox connect
</blockquote>
<li>
Maybe some comfy chairs/couches in here.
</ul>
<br><br>
<p> <li>
Eric Fong's observations:
<p>
Do some actual usability scenarios of the scheduler prototype.  Simulate every
step of the process with different actors.  E.g.,
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
profs come in and enter prefs; study them
<p> <li>
schedulers come in and try use the prof prefs to do some scheduling
</ol>
<br><br>
<p> <li>
Physical status of lab: Finished but unfurnished in a couple weeks.  We could
wheel in tables and chairs from 256.
<br><br>
<p> <li>
Eric/Franz Interaction: Eric recapitulated what he wants to do.
</ol>
