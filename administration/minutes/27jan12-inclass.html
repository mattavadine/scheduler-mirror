Kaylene presented the latest UI ideas from her and Evan.  The presentation was
given with "old school" posterboard and marking pen.  She took notes on the
storyboard posters as she made the presentation.

<p> <li>
In the storyboard notes that Kaylene took, red circles mean <em>in Week 5
release</em>; red Xs mean <em>not in Week 5 release</em>.

Given the browser-based UI, we need to be 100% clear on what the browser
functions do, in particular the back button.  James talked about how in recent-
release browsers, the browser functionality can be programmatically accessed
and overridden.  E.g., github has recently added some changes to the way the
browser's File menu behaves.  This functionality may or use for the scheduler
tool.

Details of the settings menu need to be worked out.  Some results are written
in blue and red on Kaylene's storyboards.

Evan answered the following questions about File menu operations, all of which
need to be clearly elaborated in the requirements:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
how export works
<p> <li>
how print works
</ol>

As always, the requirements need to be explained in end-user terms.
