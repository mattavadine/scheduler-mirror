Kaylene once again continued presenting the latest UI ideas from her and Evan.
She took notes on the storyboard posters as she made the presentation.
<p>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The admin side of instructor pref functionality looks like this:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
List of instructors with status that says whether or not prefs have been
submitted for the schedule at hand.
<p> <li>
No individual enable/disable prefs for each instructor; that is, either all
instructors or no instructors can submit.
<p> <li>
Two bottom buttons:
</ol>
<p> <li>
Notes on the Instructor UI:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Can do two things: enter prefs and view a schedule; zero or more schedules may
be viewable at any one time.
<p> <li>
Need to be clear about the following:
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
What does the admin press to publish a schedule?  Publish?  This still needs to
be answered.
<p> <li>
Are instructors seeing a copy of the schedule at the time of publishing or the
schedule itself, the latter of which can still be changing?  Evan suggests
using 'File Save-As' to make this explicit.  This still needs to be decided.
</ol>
<p> <li>
By vote of 9 yes, 1 no, we agreed to have the following three areas for storing
schedules:
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
Home
<p> <li>
Archive
<p> <li>
Trash
</ol>
<p>
For now, all three of these will be flat "file" lists, with the possibility in
future to make one or more of them hierarchical "file" stores.  Layoutwise, it
can look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
Home   Settings                                   Archive   Trash
</pre></blockquote>
I.e., 'Archive' and 'Trash' are on the far right of the tab bar.
<p> <li>
All agree that the next round of full-class acceptance testing will happen the
beginning of week 8, or whenever the new DB design is up and running.
