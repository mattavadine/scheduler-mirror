We discussed one major issue we have; timelines for displaying information. There is displaying and editing information per quarter, and then editing and displaying information per year.

General consensus: schedule should be edited and created per quarter, while faculty access and information should be displayed and edited per academic year.

Our big decision conflict happens when we try to create new quarters or new years; which data set should we use? Should we base the present year on the previous year? Or should we access a larger database that keeps track of all the professors?

A side task for Salo was brought up involving a common area that shows what someone is looking at. If someone is looking at a full faculty year, it will tell them which academic year. If someone is looking at a quarter, it will tell them the quarter and which academic year. This is an easily visible place that someone can look, and it updates depending on what a person is looking at.
