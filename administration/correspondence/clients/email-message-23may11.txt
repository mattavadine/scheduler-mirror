In the 2011-12 academic year, a team of computer science students will be undertaking a year-long capstone project in software engineering.  Their project will be to develop a software tool that could assist academic departments with class scheduling.  The objective of this independent project is to deliver an operational product by June 2012.

As a person involved with department scheduling, you may be interested in participating in the requirements analysis phase of the project.  The objective of the requirements phase is to gather input from a wide range of knowledgeable individuals about features that might be useful to a department in class-scheduling software.

Your involvement in the project can be as brief as a single 20-30 minute interview with a student requirements gathering team.  These interviews will take place during the beginning of the Fall 2011 quarter.  If after the initial interview you would be interested in further involvement, we would most certainly welcome it.

If you are interested in participating in this project, please reply to this message, and we'll make arrangements to discuss further details at your convenience.  It would be helpful to receive your reply by June 10.


Thank you very much indeed,
   Gene Fisher
   Professor of Computer Science
