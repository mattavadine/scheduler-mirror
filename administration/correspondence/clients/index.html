<p>
The 14 Sept list is a subset of the 13 May list.  Specifically, those excluded
from the 14 Sept list are those who did not respond at all to the 13 May
mailing, or those who responded to the 13 May mailing with an indication that
they did not wish to participate in the project.
<p>
This 30 May mailing list is a subset of the names in the spreadsheet.  Some
persons were selectively omitted from the 13 May mailing, based on a number of
factors, including recommendations from Susan Olivas, and pre-mailing contacts
enquiring about interest in the project.
