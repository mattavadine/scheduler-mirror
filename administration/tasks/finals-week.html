<a href="../../testing/acceptance">
testing/acceptance/DEPT/finals-week-report.html
</a>
</pre></blockquote>
for DEPT equal to the name of the department you were assigned to work on this
quarter.  NOTE WELL that this may or may not be the same department that where

</a>
<br>
<br>
If you did an acceptance test report for week 8 or 9, you may copy and paste it
into the finals-week-report and update the report to be consistent with the
final deployed version of the program.  If you did not do a report for weeks 8
or 9, then you must do a new one for the finals week report.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong><em>Selenium Tests for Your Assigned Department.</em></strong>
<br>
<br>
This goes in the project directory
<a href="../../Selenium/test/scheduler/view/web/shared">
Selenium/test/scheduler/view/web/shared/*AcceptanceTest*.java
</a>
per the Selenium file naming conventions developed by Salome and Evan.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong><em>Javadoc for All of Your Code.</em></strong>
<br>
<br>
This goes in the .java files that you have been responsible for this quarter.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong><em>A Summary Code Review for the Team You Were Paired
With</em></strong>
<p>
Commit the review here
<a href="../../testing/reviews/">
<tt>testing/reviews/TEAM/finals-week/review.html</tt>
</a>
where the TEAM sub-directories are <tt>algorithm</tt>, <tt>resources-
backend</tt>, <tt>schedule-views</tt>, <tt>instructor-web-app</tt>,
<tt>resources-frontend</tt>, and <tt>top-level</tt>.
<br>
<br>
If you done a recent code review, you may copy and paste it into the final
review and update to be consistent with the final deployed version of the
program.  If you have not done a inter-team code review at all this quarter,
then you must do a new one for the finals week review.  The "inter-team" code
review is for two-person team you were paired with, NOT your won two-person
team.  The pairings are those listed in the
