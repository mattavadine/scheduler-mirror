<i>I was on the requirements team this quarter and here is a summary of my accomplishments:</i>
<br>
<br>
- I created the Visio markups and documentation for the instructor management and preference sections.
<br>
<br>
- Later I adopted the room and course management sections as well and maintained the html and screenshots for those two in addition to instructor management and instructor preferences.
<br>
<br>
- Extra tasks include the Impact section of the longform and section 2.6.1 Schedule Status Management.
<br>
<br>
- Tyler Vitti and Jonathan Rawson have both told me that my work quality was the best among the requirements team.
