<strong>Fall Summary for Jonathan Rawson</strong>
</font>
</p>
<strong><font size=+1>Roles Held:</strong> Assistant Project Manager<br>
<strong>Teams:</strong> Prototype and Requirements</font>

<p>
My duties as Assistant Project Manager were mostly carried out in the beginning of the quarter. I helped Kaylene to meet with team leads and made sure I had an understanding of Microsoft Project and details of project management.
</p>

<p>
Once initial team meetings were finished, and goals were set for each time, I was assigned a role on the prototype team. I helped Eric and Tyler with some model development, and looked over possible deployment mechanisms. I wrote a white paper discussing the advantages/disadvantages of a web vs. desktop based application. The results of the paper indicated that the program would be best implemented as a web app, which was further concluded after discussion with members of the class.

After being faced with a lull in assignments from the prototype team, I switched to the requirements team to help in a preliminary "copy-editor" role. I reviewed all longform requirements before their release to Professor Fisher, and helped to incorporate the results of testing into the requirements. I also communicated with Professor Fisher about the expectations for deadlines of the requirements and passed this information onto the requirements team. In addition to reviewing requirements, I was responsible for the future work and personnel sections of the requirements.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I think I helped to develop the product from a high level. I did some minimal coding for prototype, and helped review and structure the requirements. I also helped facilitate discussion about high level design concepts (web vs. desktop, master list, etc.). I went on 2 customer interviews. These tasks have affected the development of the product and allowed for discussions that make us think about what is best for the client.
