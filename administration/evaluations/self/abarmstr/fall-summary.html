<h1 align="center">Adam Armstrong 402 Fall Summary</h1>
<hr>

<p>For the first 4(ish) weeks of the quarter I was a member of the requirements team.  On the requirements team I was responsible for the initial mockups for generating a schedule.  After some redesign it was decided that instead of using a wizard for schedule generation it would all be on what became the schedule view tab.  I was responsible for the initial design and mockup of this view.  For it I chose the two lists for chosen and available courses along with the calendar to drag courses to.</p>

<p>After about the forth week of the quarter I switched to the prototyping team where I was responsible for implementing the splash page the user sees when they login.  I was responsible for adding the functionality of creating a new schedule and opening an existing schedule.  After the splash page started filling up with other options such as import, export, save, and save as, the splash page was redesigned to be more simplistic with the additional funtionality moving to the file menu.  I was responsible for implementing many of the options in the file menu including save as and merge.</p>

<p>While working with the prototype team, I was also chosen to replace Eric Liebowitz as the person in charge of the model and scheduling algorithm next quarter.  I spent time working with Eric on learning how the scheduling algorithm works and reading the documentation provided by Eric.</p>

<p>Additionally, I went on a total of three customer interviews this quarter.</p>
