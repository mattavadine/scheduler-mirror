<i>I was on the prototype team this quarter and here is a summary of
	my accomplishments:</i>
<br>
<br>
- I created and set up the GWT Project (Prototype) and made it capable
of running on a Tomcat server. I also helped others get their
environment setup for programming in GWT.
<br>
<br>
- The majority of my tasks invlolved creating and updating the tables in
the view (instructors, locations, and courses). I added all of the
features such as error checking and filtering columns to show. Once Evan
created a custom table object to use, I integrated the new tables into
the prototype and added back all of the error checking and features that
we had previously.
<br>
<br>
- I also created the ability to upload and download csv files in the view.
