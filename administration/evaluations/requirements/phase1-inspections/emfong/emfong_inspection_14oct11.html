<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Slide Title</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Status</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Remarks</strong>
 <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Generation
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>No place to set a name for schedule...but in "Select a Term" schedules are named.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Generation Error
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Modify courses is too vague. Modify courses for the error-ing term? For the professor?
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Generation Error
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Links are not the entire text, why is only one word the link? Personal preference IMO, I'd prefer the whole word.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule View Empty
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>No place for the name of the term anywhere.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule View Filled
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>No place for the name of the term anywhere.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule View Class Filled
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Inconsistency between this and others. Search for "CHEM - 124" or "CHEM 124"? It's displayed with a dash in search, and without in content.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Filtering
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>How do you know if filtering is enabled? On previous slides while looking at schedules, there's no indicator...
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Filtering
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Room list has teacher names. Could be very confusing for the customers, please change that!
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Filtering
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Turning people "off" currently makes them look highlighted. Is this the intended functionality? Maybe want to evaluate this again.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Courses Manage
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>"Configure Courses" is ambiguous. Is this for an instructor to teach, or a whole department? Also, no term anywhere. Which term is this for?
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Room Availability
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>What do the different colors mean for availability? Red = error/critical/lab room? Yellow = half-error?

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Slide Title</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Status</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Remarks</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Story Line</em>
    <td valign=top>DONE
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Look</em>
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Toolbar should have some additional information. Who you are, what your status is (professor/administrator), what term you are looking at, etc.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Content</em>
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>A few cases of inconsistencies. Searching courses is not the same as the courses that are displayed (dash/no-dash).
