Clerical prose style edits.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Select a Term
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
Here and the remainder, the left nav frame is never explained, nor does it
change highlight meaningfully with slide changes.  It should be,
or removed entirely.  I vote for the latter.
    <td valign=top>Fisher, may others
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Generating Schedule
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
When we left on Wed, I thought we decided to use CHEM, not IME for all
examples.  Did this decision change?
<p>
Also: titles inconsistent, overall width too wide, particularly if wrap is
disabled in blurb text.
    <td valign=top>Fisher
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Scheduling Conflict
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
I think this should have a border of some form, as in fact, should all the
windows.  Next link is inconsistent with index.  Title inconsistent with index.

    <td valign=top>View Blank Schedule

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Generated Schedule
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
I still think the proliferation of colors is distracting, but I will defer if a
substantial majority disagree.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Course Schedule
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
Here also I am distracted by a lack of meaning to the colors.  I don't think
random color selection is helpful, which judgment is backed up by UI research.
    <td valign=top>Fisher, ?
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Department Schedule
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
I don't see this as different from the 'ScheduleViewFilled.html' slide.  If
Tempus is department-specific, why do I need something called "department
view".  Maybe this is just nomenclature, but in any case, I need to know if
there's a difference between this and the 'ScheduleViewFilled.html' slide.
    <td valign=top>Fisher
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Schedule Department, Hovering
    <td valign=top>DONE
    <td valign=top>
Content alone is good, needs to be made consistent with all other slides, which
I'll take as a global pattern issue.

OK as stand-alone, but needs to be made consistent with course and room
management.

I'd like to see the signal color scheme used.  I'd like to see another screen

    <td valign=top>Manage Rooms
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
In terms of interface style, this is consistent with course management.  In
terms of look, it's inconsistent, most particular in terms of image, and
therefore font size, as well as font color.  Such inconsistencies are not a
huge deal, but they I they are entirely unnecessary, and potentially
distracting.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Look</em>
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
If we're still TBD with the logo, we should leave it out all together.  If the
objective of the banner is to instill brand identification, I don't think it
works well at all with "Logo TBD".  Benefit of removing
entire 'Logo ... Tempus ...' banner is simplification and improved focus on
functionality.
<p>
Slide names in index need to match titles in slides.  E.g., "Generating
Schedule" versus Schedule Generation
<p>
Font sizes are distractingly different sizes.
<p>
Banner-forced width is too wide for 17'' display screen.
    <td valign=top>Fisher and ?
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Content</em>
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
Major problem: dialog-centric versus table-centric management of instructors
versus courses is not consistent.
<p>
Side nav bar is not well integated, and inconsistent in places -- 'Manage' at
bottom versus 'Export Schedule, Configuration'
<p>
Clerical: I would very much prefer present tense, not future.
