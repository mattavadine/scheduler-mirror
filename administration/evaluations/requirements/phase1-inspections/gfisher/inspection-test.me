Scheduler GUI Walkthrough	FIX	T{
needs styling and a bit of wordsmithing
T}	Fisher
Log In	FIX	T{
Clerical prose style edits.
T}	Fisher
Select a Term	FIX	T{
Here and the remainder, the left nav frame is never explained, nor does it
change highlight meaningfully with slide changes.  It should be,
or removed entirely.  I vote for the latter.
T}	Fisher, may others
Generating Schedule	FIX	T{
When we left on Wed, I thought we decided to use CHEM, not IME for all
examples.  Did this decision change?
.sp
Also: titles inconsistent, overall width too wide, particularly if wrap is
disabled in blurb text.
T}	Fisher
Scheduling Conflict	FIX	T{
I think this should have a border of some form, as in fact, should all the
windows.  Next link is inconsistent with index.  Title inconsistent with index.
T}	Fisher, ?

View Blank Schedule	FIX	T{
Not properly linked in Prev/Next chain.  Not clear what user did to make it
come up.
T}	Fisher, ?
View Generated Schedule	FIX	T{
I still think the proliferation of colors is distracting, but I will defer if a
substantial majority disagree.
.pp
Not properly linked in Prev/Next chain.  Not clear what user did to make it
come up.
T}	Fisher, ?
View Instructor Schedule	FIX	T{
Not properly labeled.
T}	Fisher, ?
View Course Schedule	FIX	T{
Here also I am distracted by a lack of meaning to the colors.  I don't think
random color selection is helpful, which judgment is backed up by UI research.
T}	Fisher, ?
View Department Schedule	FIX	T{
I don't see this as different from the 'ScheduleViewFilled.html' slide.  If
Tempus is department-specific, why do I need something called "department
view".  Maybe this is just nomenclature, but in any case, I need to know if
there's a difference between this and the 'ScheduleViewFilled.html' slide.
T}	Fisher
View Schedule Department, Hovering	DONE	T{
Content alone is good, needs to be made consistent with all other slides, which
I'll take as a global pattern issue.
T}	Fisher

Filters View	FIX	T{
I know we're not doing full action/result scenarios here, but I would very much
like to know how the user gets here
T}	Fisher
Filters View, Selected Days	FIX	T{
Ditto.
T}	Fisher
Filters View, Selected Instructors	FIX	T{
Ditto.
T}	Fisher

Instructor Management	FIX	T{
Instructor information should be expanded to agree with current model.  How
it's edited should be mentioned.
T}	Fisher
Add Instructor	FIX	T{
Describe user action to get here (easy).
T}	Fisher
Add Instructor, Filled In	DONE	T{
I like the empty/filled-in transition.  Would like to see more of this style
throughout.
T}	Fisher
Edit Instructor	FIX	T{
I like the empty/filled-in transition.  Would like to see more of this style
throughout.
T}	Fisher
Remove Instructor	FIX	T{
OK as stand-alone, but needs to be made consistent with course and room
management.
T}	Fisher
Instructor Course Preferences	FIX	T{
I'd like to see the signal color scheme used.  I'd like to see another screen
with one of the menus pulled down.
T}	Fisher
Instructor Time Preferences	FIX	T{
Needs a filled-in version, with color-scheme in use.
T}	Fisher
Instructor Distance Preference	FIX	T{
Needs at least one more short sentence explaining how it affects scheduling.
T}	
Instructor Overview	FIX	T{
404 not found
T}	Fisher, ?

Manage Courses	FIX	T{
Blurb needs clarification regarding this screen as "starting point for various
actions ... on the data".
T}	Fisher, ?
Add Course, Filled In	FIX	T{
Inconsistency with instructor management needs to be reconciled.
T}	Fisher, ?
Edit Course	FIX	T{
Inconsistency with instructor management needs to be reconciled.
T}	Fisher, ?
Remove Course	FIX	T{
Inconsistency with instructor management needs to be reconciled.
T}	Fisher, ?
Manage Courses, Adding Course	FIX	T{
Inconsistency with instructor management needs to be reconciled.
T}	Fisher, ?

Manage Rooms	FIX	T{
In terms of interface style, this is consistent with course management.  In
terms of look, it's inconsistent, most particular in terms of image, and
therefore font size, as well as font color.  Such inconsistencies are not a
huge deal, but they I they are entirely unnecessary, and potentially
distracting.
T}	Fisher, ?
Add Room	FIX	T{
See general room management remark.
T}	Fisher, ?
Remove Room	FIX	T{
See general room management remark.
T}	Fisher, ?
Room Availability	FIX	T{
See general room management remark.

\fIStory Line\fP	DONE		 
\fIConsistent Look\fP	FIX 	T{
If we're still TBD with the logo, we should leave it out all together.  If the
objective of the banner is to instill brand identification, I don't think it
works well at all with "Logo TBD".  Benefit of removing
entire 'Logo ... Tempus ...' banner is simplification and improved focus on
functionality.
.sp
Slide names in index need to match titles in slides.  E.g., "Generating
Schedule" versus Schedule Generation
.sp
Font sizes are distractingly different sizes.
.sp
Banner-forced width is too wide for 17'' display screen.
T}	Fisher and ?
\fIConsistent Content\fP	FIX	T{
Major problem: dialog-centric versus table-centric management of instructors
versus courses is not consistent.
.sp
Side nav bar is not well integated, and inconsistent in places -- 'Manage' at
bottom versus 'Export Schedule, Configuration'
.sp
Clerical: I would very much prefer present tense, not future.
