  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Setup
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>The row of cells under the day cells seems unnessary and could be confused for a timeslot.  The two lists should have titles identifying what they hold.

    <td valign=top>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Blank Schedule
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>The slide title is misleading; it would seem to indicate that the screen should hold a schedule with nothing in it.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Generated Schedule
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>When a course spans multiple hours, a block with it's name appears in each row it spans; this could be misinterpreted to mean that multiple sections of the course are being scheduled back to back rather than the time span belonging to one section. When a course spans multiple hours, it's name should appear in one block that spans multiple rows.

    <td valign=top>View Instructor Schedule
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>"Intellegent search" is a technical term, not really necessary.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>View Course Schedule
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Typo at end of blurb: "...for which many sections...", remove word "many".

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Filters View, Selected Instructor
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>If the user wants to view only a subset of instructors, courses, or locations, it seems cumbersome to have to click on each item they <b>don't</b> want to see. Unless the subset contains more than half of the available items, the user will have to do more clicks than they would if selecting an item showed what they <b>do</b> want to see.  This would be a good one for usability personel to look into.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Instructor Course Preferences
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Other preference levels besides "Acceptable" should appear, this would make it more clear what this screen can do.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Instructor Time Preferences
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Grayscale looks dated, but I believe colors were already ruled out for some reason which I can't recall. Interface for specifing times and days seems like it would require a lot of data entry.  Alternative ideas: why not click and drag out a timeslot then be prompted for a preference level?  For deleting a prefence, why not right click on a time slot and select delete?
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Instructor Distance Preference
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Minor detail: This interface should specify that the building entered should be a number and not the name of the building.  The user might enter "Frank E. Pilling" instead of 14.
