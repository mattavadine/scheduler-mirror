<h2>
General Observations
</h2>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
I like the slide-like style of the walk-through, but it needs an underlying
"interesting and engaging story line", as discussed in the
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/lectures/3.html#story-line">
CSC 308 notes.
</a>

<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I put a "Start the Scheduler Tool" slide at the very top, since it should be
the slide show entry point.
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
I understand that Matt S. and Tyler Y. have a version of the top-level UI that
isn't yet hooked into the slide show.
<p> <li>
I look forward to seeing this.
</ol>
<p> <li>
After the initials screen, I put a couple generation slides at the beginning,
since auto-generation seems to be a popular feature with many of the clients
we've interviewed so far.
<p> <li>
I put basic viewing after generation since, for me, it follows better in a
story line.  The more advanced filtered viewing I left at the end, since it's a
level of detail that is better to put later in the story.
<p> <li>
I added course management and put it before room management, since I believe
overall courses are a more important feature.
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
Based on input from Kaylene, course management slides were supposed to be done
Erik W.
<p> <li>
HEY ERIK -- WE NEED YOUR STUFF!  If it's an SVN issue, send me your files by
mail and I'll commit them.
</ol>
<p> <li>
<strong><em>IN-CLASS DECISION:</em></strong> The consensus is that the
preceding proposed story line is fundamentally sound, and Mike S. has updated
and committed walkthru/index.html accordingly.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
Aesthetically, I believe we have CSS prettifying in the plans, correct?
<p>
<p> <li>
There is a question as to whether we should use the standard Poly web style, as
defined at
<a href="http://warc.calpoly.edu/">
Web Authoring Resource Center,
</a>
or have one of our own.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
<br><br>
<p> <li>
I prefer the latter, i.e., our own CSS style.
<p> <li>
If we do so, we may need some form of graceful transition from the currently
WARC-styled scheduler web page.
<p> <li>
Another option is to skip the WARC style altogether, including at the top-
levels of the Scheduler Project web page.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
The introductory paragraphs at
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/release/alpha/scheduler/requirements/walkthru/index.html">
<tt>requirements/walkthru/index.html</tt>
</a>
need some wordsmithing.  I'll do some in the next couple days and present on
Wednesday in class.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
A particular need is to explain that we've not yet had time to take into
account all of the specific features that were discussed during the initial in-
person interviews, but will do so in the next requirements release.
<p> <li>
This ties into the deeper requirements analysis discussed in
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/402/lectures/week4.pdf">
402 lecture notes week 4.
</a>
<p> <li>
For this week's release, we'll do our best informally to address specific
client concerns, and inform the clients that we'll do more next time.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
We need to use a consistent prose style throughout.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I definitely prefer
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/handouts/spec-doc-outline.html#prose-conventions">
the prose convention for CSC 308,
</a>
that specifies present tense, third person, active voice.
<p> <li>
If we don't do this exactly, we still must have a <em>consistent</em> prose
style.
<li>
Not to pick on any one specifically, I think the following is a good example of
why passive voice can be confusing, since it is unclear precisely what the user
does to perform a search:
<blockquote>
<em>"When a teacher is searched for in the search box, the table is filled with
the classes that teacher is scheduled to teach for the quarter."</em>
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
Are we OK with using CSC department as the data example, or should use a
generic set of instructor names?
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I'm inclined to go generic.
<p> <li>
If we use CSC, we need a compelling rationalization of this to the explanation
readers.
<p> <li>
<strong><em>IN-CLASS DECISION:</em></strong> We will use the CHEM department as
the consistent example throughout all of the requirements scenarios and slides.
Mike S. is sending a message to the Chem department client he interviewed to
confirm that his is OK with their department.  We expect that it will be.
</ol>
<p> <li>
We need to use consistent terminology throughout:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
<strong>Instructor</strong>, not Teacher (simply for consistency)
<p> <li>
<strong>Course</strong>, not Class (simply for consistency, either will do)
<p> <li>
<strong>Location</strong>, not Classroom (to avoid potential confusion with
lecture room versus lab room versus some other kind of location altogether)
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
I very much liked the consistency among the management UIs that is present in a
number of the scheduler tools form previous 308 work, e.g.,
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-archive/308-f07/afternoon/requirements/">
http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-
archive/308-f07/afternoon/requirements/
</a>
or
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-archive/308-f09/afternoon/requirements/room-add.html">
http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-
archive/308-f09/afternoon/requirements/room-add.html
</a>
<strong><em>IN-CLASS DISCUSSION:</em></strong> Michael H. mentioned that he and
other requirements team members have discussed a form of uniform editing for
instructors, courses, and locations.  What they've come up with is a direct-
edit tabular view, with object-specific column headings.  I look forward to
seeing this.
<p>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical</em> -- I think the slide blurb would be better to the right of
the figure.
</ol>

<h2>
Walk-Thru Files
</h2>
<p>
The following file-specific comments are in addition to the general discussion
above.

<h3>
FilterOn.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Images are broken.
<p> <li>
Needs to tie in with viewing section of the slides.
</ol>

<h3>
FilterSomeOffScroll.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Needs a blurb and consistent look with other slides.
<p> <li>
'Read More'  link is wrong.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleView*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
This is not yet in the consistent slide-at-a-time walk-through format.
<p> <li>
The first slide appears to have all of the content that is then displayed in
the individual slides.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewClassFilled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
What happens if there is more than one section at the same time?  This is a
fine detail, but there's nothing immediately in the display that helps me
understand how it might be handled.
<p> <li>
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewEmpty.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Needs blurb and consistent look.
<p> <li>
Should be the first single slide in the View section.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Not linked in the slides.  Is this correct?
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilledDept.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Definitely</em> needs a blurb, since it's unclear what colors mean.
<p> <li>
'Read More' link is wrong.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilledDeptHover.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
I like the hover idea.
<p> <li>
As noted for the previous slide, the colors should have some meaning, or at
least an explanation of why they're different.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-add.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
The description of the "Add button in the bottom center" does not seem to apply
here.
<p> <li>
The look and layout comments from the room-main slide apply here.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-advanced.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The look and layout comments from the room-main slide apply here.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-main-filled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Look is not consistent (clerical).
<p> <li>
Definitely needs a blurb to describe the screens.
<p> <li>
My impression is that this UI is too complicated for a first entry point, and
not consistent with the instructor management UIs.  I suggest having the 'Room
Availability' dialog come up separately, rather than by default in the initial
display.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-main.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
</ol>

<h3>
index.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical</em> -- needs a CSS.
<p> <li>
I suggest subdividing it into labeled subsections: Generate, View, Instructors,
Courses, Rooms, Filter.
</ol>

<h3>
instructor-*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
These have the basic necessary features.
<p> <li>
The add and remove slides should be consistent, either both showing or not
showing the instructor list
<p> <li>
Per comments elsewhere, they need to be made consistent with the other
management UIs.
</ol>

<h3>
instructor-pref-*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Even the slide blurb should describe the user action that leads to the UI being
displayed.
<p> <li>
In course prefs, I'm not sure about the drag interface, as opposed to a simpler
two-column list with courses and keyword or numeric pref value (or radio
buttons).
<p> <li>
I like the times pref tab.
<p> <li>
I like the distance pref tab.
</ol>

<h3>
template.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical:</em> Needs to be removed for the walk-through index.
<p> <li>
Visio is a good tool, but it would be nice to have the look and feel be a
little less Windows-like.  Is there a Visio setting to do this?
</ol>

<h3>
FilterOn.html
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The images are broken here.
</ul>

<h2>
Detailed Requirments Scenario Files
</h2>
<p>
<strong><em>IN-CLASS DECISION:</em></strong> We decided that we will
<em>NOT</em> include the detailed requirements scenarios in the Phase 1 release
this Friday.  This includes removing the 'Read More' link on all of the slides.
Therefore, addressing all of the comments below is deferred until
<em>AFTER</em> the Phase 1 release.
<p>
The following file-specific comments are in addition to the general discussion
above.  To summarize, the most important to-do items are these:
<ul>
<li>
Use a consistent prose style, with the
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/handouts/spec-doc-outline.html#prose-conventions">
308 conventions
</a>
as the default.
<li>
Use a common UI look for all slides.
<li>
As discussed in
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/402/lectures/week3.pdf">
402 Notes Week 3,
</a>
</ul>
have a consistent relationship between the blurb on the slides and the
beginning sentence or two in the scenarios.
</ul>
<strong><em>Again, since we will not release the detailed scenarios for Phase
1, work on them is deferred until after Friday 14 October.</em></strong>

<h3>
database-instructor.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Clerical: The prose style needs to be fixed.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Use present tense, no "will".  E.g., "In this view, the user sees a list of
instructors."
<p> <li>
Use third person.  E.g., "To add an instructor, the user clicks the 'Add'
button."
</ol>
<p> <li>
Basic content looks satisfactory.  To refine further, we need to
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Make sure we have all instructor attributes mentioned  in any client
interviews, in particular the supporting documentation supplied by some
clients.
<p> <li>
Make the instructor information in the scenarios consistent with the existing
data model in the Java model code.
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>
database-room.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
As noted above, I think the 'Room Availability' frame should be accessible with
a user click, not part of the initial display.
<p> <li>
The prose style needs to be made consistent.  Again, I suggest the
<a href=".(Ah" http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/spec-doc-outline#prose-conventions>
308 convention
</a>
</ol>
