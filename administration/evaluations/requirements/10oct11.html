<h2>
General Observations
</h2>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
I like the slide-like style of the walk-through, but it needs an underlying
"interesting and engaging story line", as discussed in the
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/lectures/3.html#story-line">
CSC 308 notes.
</a>
Here's a concrete suggestion:
<blockquote>

<br>

<br>

<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I put generation first since it seems to be a popular feature.
<p> <li>
I put viewing after generation since, for me, it follows better in a story
line.
<p> <li>
I added course management and put it before room management, since I believe
overall courses are a more important feature.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
Aesthetically, I believe we have CSS prettifying in the plans, correct?
<p>
<p> <li>
There is a question as to whether we should use the standard Poly web style, as
defined at
<a href="http://warc.calpoly.edu/">
Web Authoring Resource Center,
</a>
or have one of our own.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I prefer the latter, i.e., our own CSS style.
<p> <li>
If we do so, we may need some form of graceful transition from the currently
WARC-styled scheduler web page.
<p> <li>
Another option is to skip the WARC style altogether, including at the top-
levels of the Scheduler Project web page.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
The introductory paragraphs at
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/release/alpha/scheduler/requirements/walkthru/index.html">
<tt>requirements/walkthru/index.html</tt>
</a>
need some wordsmithing.  I'll do some in the next couple days and present on
Wednesday in class.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
A particular need is to explain that we've not yet had time to take into
account all of the specific features that were discussed during the initial in-
person interviews, but will do so in the next requirements release.
<p> <li>
This ties into the deeper requirements analysis discussed in
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/402/lectures/week4.pdf">
402 lecture notes week 4.
</a>
<p> <li>
For this week's release, we'll do our best informally to address specific
client concerns, and inform the clients that we'll do more next time.
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
We need to use a consistent prose style throughout.
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I definitely prefer
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/handouts/spec-doc-outline.html#prose-conventions">
the prose convention for CSC 308,
</a>
that specifies present tense, third person, active voice.
<p> <li>
If we don't do this exactly, we still must have a <em>consistent</em> prose
style.
<li>
Not to pick on any one specifically, I think the following is a good example of
why passive voice can be confusing, since it is unclear precisely what the user
does to perform a search:
<blockquote>
<em>"When a teacher is searched for in the search box, the table is filled with
the classes that teacher is scheduled to teach for the quarter."</em>
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
Are we OK with using CSC department as the data example, or should use a
generic set of instructor names?
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
I'm inclined to go generic.
<p> <li>
If we use CSC, we need a compelling rationalization of this to the explanation
readers.
</ol>
<p> <li>
We need to use consistent terminology throughout:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
<strong>Instructor</strong>, not Teacher (simply for consistency)
<p> <li>
<strong>Course</strong>, not Class (simply for consistency, either will do)
<p> <li>
<strong>Room</strong>, not Classroom (to avoid potential confusion with lecture
versus lab room)
</ol>
<p>
<p> <li>
I very much liked the consistency among the management UIs that is present in a
number of the scheduler tools form prevous 308 work, e.g.,
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-archive/308-f07/afternoon/requirements/">
http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-
archive/308-f07/afternoon/requirements/
</a>
or
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-archive/308-f09/afternoon/requirements/room-add.html">
http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes-
archive/308-f09/afternoon/requirements/room-add.html
</a>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical</em> -- I think the slide blurb would be better to the right of
the figure.
</ol>

<h2>
Walk-Thru Files
</h2>

<h3>
FilterOn.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Images are broken.
<p> <li>
Needs to tie in with viewing section of the slides.
</ol>

<h3>
FilterSomeOffScroll.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Needs a blurb and consisten look with other slides.
<p> <li>
Details link is wrong.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleView*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
This is not yet in the consistent slide-at-a-time walk-through format.
<p> <li>
The first slide appears to have all of the content that is then displayed in
the individual slides.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewClassFilled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
What happens if there is more than one section at the same time?
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewEmpty.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Needs blurb and consistent look.
<p> <li>
Should be the first single slide in the View section.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Not linked in the slides.  Is this correct?
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilledDept.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Definitely</em> needs a blurb, since it's unclear what colors mean.
<p> <li>
'Read More' link is wrong.
</ol>

<h3>
ScheduleViewFilledDeptHover.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
I like the hover idea.
<p> <li>
As noted for previous slide, the colors should have some meaning, or at least
an explanation of why they're different.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-add.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
The description of the "Add button in the bottom center" does not seem to apply
here.
<p> <li>
The look and layout comments from the room-main slide apply here.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-advanced.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The look and layout comments from the room-main slide apply here.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-main-filled.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Look is not consistent (clerical).
<p> <li>
Definitely needs a blurb to describe the screens.
<p> <li>
My impression is that is UI is too complicated for a first entry point, and not
consistent with the instructor management UIs.  I suggest having the 'Room
Availability' dialog come up separatey, rather than by default in the intial
display.
</ol>

<h3>
database-room-main.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
</ol>

<h3>
index.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical</em> -- needs a CSS.
<p> <li>
I suggest subdividing it into labeled subsections: Generate, View, Instructors,
Courses, Rooms, Filter.
</ol>

<h3>
instructor-*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
These have the basic necessary features.
<p> <li>
The add and remove slides should be consistent, either both showing or not
showing the instrctor list
<p> <li>
Per comments elsehwhere, they need to be made consistent with the other
management UIs.
</ol>

<h3>
instructor-pref-*.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Even the slide blurb should describe the user action that leads to the UI being
displayed.
<p> <li>
In course prefs, I'm not sure about the drag interface, as opposed to a simpler
two-column list with courses and keyword or numeric pref value (or radio
buttons).
<p> <li>
I like the times pref tab.
<p> <li>
I like the distance pref tab.
</ol>

<h3>
template.html
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Clerical:</em> Needs to be removed for the walk-through index.
<p> <li>
Visio is a good tool, but it would be nice to have the look and feel be a
little less Windows-like.  Is there a Visio setting to do this?
</ol>

<h3>
FilterOn.html
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The images are broken here.
