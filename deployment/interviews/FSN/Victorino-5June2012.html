        Jill wanted the ability to ensure that 2 or more courses never overlap in time. This covers the use case where students need to take both of those classes in the quarter, and they need to be offered at different times so that one student can take both classes.
        <br><br>
        Jill thinks it would be better to have "Not Qualified" by default for instructor preferences or an ability to change what the defaults are in a settings menu.
        <br><br>
        As we've heard before, Jill wants a way to make sure that other department's classes (like BIO) don't overlap with certain FSN classes.
        <br><br>
        Kaylene was trying to manipulate a schedule manually, through drag and drop and trying to save, ultimately "breaking" the FSN deployment through data corruption.
        
        <br><br>
        Jill thought that it was annoying that the pop-up associated with the drag and drop, didn't by default have a "valid" number of hours. She thinks that it would be easier if drag and drop only allowed you to drag times, leaving the day combo the same as it was scheduled when the pop-up comes up, with the start and end times changed to valid values. Then, if you wanted to change the day combos, you could do it manually in the pop-up.
        <br><br>
        Jill said that SCU's aren't necessary for her to put in because SCU's are generally populated automatically by peoplesoft.
        <br><br>
        The tethered field isn't necessary for the FSN department.
        <br><br>
        FSN is not totally interested in letting the instructors enter their own preferences.
        <br><br>
        Jill is interested in actually using this. She says that good defaults for drag-and-drop are necessary for her to be able to actually use it.
