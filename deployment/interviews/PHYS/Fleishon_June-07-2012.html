<h1>Spring 2012 PHYS demo</h1>

<b>Time and Date of Interview: </b>  June 7, 2012 at 11am<br>
<b>Names of Team Members Attending: </b> Carsten Pfeffer and Evan Ovadia<br>
<b>Names of Attending Clients: </b>   Dr. Neil Fleishon<br>
<b>Location of Interview: </b>    Dr. Fleishon's office. Bld. 52 - D42<br>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Asked for Peoplesoft integration</li>
    <li>He would like to be able to define own class types (like add a new "4 hours per week course with MWF day combination") (in a way this is already possible through duplication of already existing classes)</li>
    <li>He asked for an undo function</li>
    <li>suggested colour codes for the different class types in the schedule tab</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 2</h2>
No Comments.

<h2>Section 3</h2>
Reaction on two forms of viewing the schedule:
<ul>
    <li>suggested color coding for different course types to make it easier to group courses / sections which belong together</li>
    <li>The classes next to each other (in calender view) have to be in different rooms, since they are at the same time. It would be good to be able to see the rooms in calender view just by adding column descriptions (a second column header below the day) because each course column is in a different room</li>
    <li>Sorting for the list view columns is not implemented</li>
</ul>
Reaction on Drag and Drop
<ul>
    <li>Drag and drop didn't work in the demo (the course was not placed after dropping it).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 4</h2>
Missing features:
    <ul>
        <li>Peoplesoft integration</li>
        <li>To be able to connect courses to certain rooms (in some physics courses some labs have to be scheduled in a certain room)</li>
        <li>Undo</li>
        <li>Suggestion: To be able to set a least amount of preps (catalog numbers) for instructors</li>
        <li>(just a suggestion): To be able to generalize preferences (Instructors can say (not am / not pm)) instead of preferences by hour and day</li>
    </ul>
Other Questions:<br/>
    <i> - none - </i><br/>
    <br/>
"Would you use it?"
    <ul>
        <li>Currently he collects the instructors' preferences with a self made web form, he just has to transfer them manually.</li>
        <li>Maybe he would use it, if the missing features (especially the Peoplesoft integration and the physics specific ones) were implemented. Right now it is useless for him.</li>
    </ul>

<i>(Note: The demonstration was not made on his computer, because he said that his custom mouse gestures wourld always irritate other people)</i>
