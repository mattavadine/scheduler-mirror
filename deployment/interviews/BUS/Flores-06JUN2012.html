<strong>Notes</strong>:
<br>
We tried making an audio recording of the interview on Matt's phone, but it stopped
recording after 15 seconds since it was out of memory. We did not realize this until 
the end, so this transcript is all we have for the interview. It does have many
direct quotes and opinions of the person we interviewed.
<br>

<h4>
Part 1 -- Demonstrating the Prototype to the Client
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Described the steps of logging in, and mentioned how the login would be validated later</li>
<li>Talked about creating a schedule</li>
<li>Walked through inserting a course</li>
<li>Mentioned how the options change based on the SCU</li>
<li>Asked about schedulable. "If you don't check it, it won't put it on your current schedule?"</li>
<li>"Is that so that I can have this on the schedule but use it in another quarter"</li>
<li>"That's good since it keeps all the courses instead of just the ones for this year"</li>
<li>Demoed instructor preferences</li>
<li>"Some rooms are not used for lectures, just for meetings"</li>
<li>"So you've entered in instructors, courses, and locations. What happens next?"</li>
<li>Described how schedule generation goes</li>
<li>"What will happen when you try to schedule an instructor on a day that he cannot teach? Will there be an error message?"</li>
<li>"Can it show you the instructor? Other than just showing the course name/number"</li>
<li>"It should generate a schedule based on preferences"</li>
<li>"Is the idea behind this that each department fills out their data, and put on PeopleSoft"</li>
<li>"So is there a way to export it as an Excel file and upload to PeopleSoft"</li>
<li>After generating calendar view, asked "What does list view look like?"</li>
<li>"Our college is a little different. I do the entire schedule, so I could see them doing something like
	generating this and then submitting it to me. Then I could manipulate it when it comes to me and then
	upload to PeopleSoft."</li>
<li>"Setting restrictions on what people can do (like uploading to PeopleSoft) would be something
	we need"</li>
<li>"For the most part, the schedules that come to me are finalized, but I do have to do some tweaking. 
	It would be great to have the schedules come to the dean's office, and then we just look at it and
	upload it to PeopleSoft"</li>
<li>"We need an approval process to approve the schedule, based on the use of the rooms and the needs of
	the college"</li>
<li>"I am responsible for what goes in to the schedule"</li>
<li>"The reason I ask about the continuous manipulation of the schedule is because there
	are changes that happen over time and the schedule needs to be updated. Is that something that
	this would be a good tool to use to keep manipulating?"</li>
<li>"There is an approval process when posting to PeopleSoft."</li>
<li>"What happens right now is that I get schedules and sometimes there's a conflict. It would be great
	if I could merge this and see where the conflicts are."</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Part 2 -- Overseeing the Client Using the Prototype
</h4>
The clients were happy with the demo. Didn't feel the need to use the scheduler right now.


<h4>
Part 3 -- Questions about Requirements Features
</h4>
<ul>
<li>They asked about the timeline for the project. We mentioned it could be taken up next year</li>
<li>"On calendar, add instructor names and section number. On spreadsheet view, add the area (departments)"<li>
<li>"If you have another demo, we would bring in the administrators at each department to see it and give
	feedback since they would use it before coming to the dean's office"</li>
<li>"We would use the feature that would show instructors the schedule for review."</li>
<li>"We would like a way to have an approval process of different administrators that make schedules
	and then send them to the Deans office"</li>
<li>"I would like a way to see the Professor's names on the calendar view, and section number. If it's
	printable that would be great. We would like a printable calendar view."</li>
<li>"In our college we have departments so we would like another column that has subdepartments
	in order to identify which courses are part of each subdepartment. Ex: accounting, management, etc."</li>
<li>Other views: "Like the two views we have. The two views we use in access are very similar. The only thing
	might be a report that will show workload and what each professor is teaching. Other types of reports
	where you can see workload and history by professor."</li>
<li>"Features with conflicts are great. Whatever way you can show conflicts would be great so we can catch 
	them as soon as possible."</li>
<li>A problem list would be nice so that you can see what needs to be done</li>
<li>"Filter view would be great. Would like to see a schedule by instructor."</li>
<li>"Like to see spreadsheet sorting by location, time, instructor, etc. The more we can sort the better."</li>
</ul>


<h4>
Part 4 -- Qualitative Assessment
</h4>
<ul>
<li>"By looking at the calendar, I'm not going to know who is teaching each course. It would be nice to 
	see more info about the instructor so that I can visually see the schedule really quickly. It would
	be nice to add the last name of the instructor and the first initial of each as well."</li>
<li>"I currently use Microsoft Access to maintain the schedule on my computer. Whenever there is a change, 
	I email that to class scheduling. This is great for creating the schedule, and if I can export it to 
	Excel or Access, I can continue manipulating it in that way."</li>
<li>"I think the areas would like this for making their schedule, and then send it to me so that I can approve
	it and send it to PeopleSoft"</li>
</ul>


<h4>
Final Comments
</h4>
"I think it's a great tool at the planning phase of the schedule!"
<br>
"I think the areas would really like it, since it's a stress to get the schedule done."
