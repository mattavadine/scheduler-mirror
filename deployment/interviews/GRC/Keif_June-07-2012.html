Features needed for adoption:
	At least a Day view, faculty view, course view, ability to have co-teachers.
	
	Currently Dr. Keif uses a program called <a href=http://schedulingstudio.com/>Lantiv Timetabler 6</a>.  Timetabler is meant
		for elementary schools but has some interesting features.  It allows subviews, ie. Have a main view then have another view in the corner.
		It also allows for visual feedback of what spots a course is valid and where it isn't.  It also does this when for both teachers when a course is
		jointly taught.
		
Questions:
	None
	
Adoptability:
	If it had more features (like the ones he mentioned) and it was stable, Dr. Keif would consider using it.
