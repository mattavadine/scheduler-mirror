<h2>Section 1</h2>
<pre>
Potential Issue: 
	Rooms may not be known when scheduling. In the CHEM (and possible BIO) depts: a Schedule is made up, rooms are assigned by later by the dept.<br>
Feature Request:  
	It would be nice to have more control over when courses cannot be scheduled.  
	There are various courses that cannot be offered at the same time.  Perhaps there could be a list or a setting 
	that does not allow certain classes to be scheduled at the same times.<br>
Feature Request:  
	A grid view.  Allows an overview of what various instructors are teaching.<br>
</pre>

<h2>Section 2</h2>
<pre>
Expressed interest in using this alongside he usual scheduling method, with full awareness that it is a prototype and may be unreliable.<br>
</pre>

<h2>Section 3</h2>
<pre>
Calendar View:
	Possible issue: The calendar view seems extremely busy if there are a large number of courses scheduled.
	Feature Request: Ability to view only particular courses or instructors in the calendar view.
Drag and Drop:
	Asked if the dialog box when placing courses comes up everytime.  Maybe if a class is dragged it'll just move the class and if double clicked bring up the Dialog box.

</pre>
<h2>Section 4</h2>
<pre>
Missing Features:
	Other the previously mentioned, interdepartmental integration would be nice so courses needed in other dept don't conflict.

Questions:
	Gave him CHEM dept URL so he can try it while doing Winter 2013 Schedule.
	
Adopability:
	If issues were worked out and made stable, it would be adoptable.
