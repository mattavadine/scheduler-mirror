<h4>
Part 1 -- Demonstrating the Prototype to the Client
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wayne asked about the status of the project. We described where its at.</li>
<li>"Did the initial interviews, but have not seen it since"</li>
<li>Data values were wrong, but we explained how they we are just showing functionality of the resource tables</li>
<li>Wayne asked why we used the Cal Poly username, explained how it was the unique identifier</li>
<li>Wayne asked about both sides of the project, one for instructors, and one for admins. We explained
	what role each part played</li>
<li>We talked about the sheets used to indicate professor preferences, asked how they would be used in the program</li>
<li>Wayne asked about PeopleSoft and mentioned how the locations don't matter until you post to PeopleSoft</li>
<li>"We would like to be able to filter the view by each class level"</li>
<li>"We would also like more variability in the schedule so that sections of the same class are offered 
    at different times"</li>
<li>Wayne noted that this could take place of the paper version of preferences</li>
<li>Had to make a new document because the old EE website was not accessible after using making the schedule view</li>
<li>Wayned asked what multiple documents mean, so we told them about having multiple documents for different schedules</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Part 2 -- Overseeing the Client Using the Prototype
</h4>
The clients were too busy to participate in using the product, but would be interested
in using it sometime in the future when it is complete.


<h4>
Part 3 -- Questions about Requirements Features
</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Do the list view by course and faculty member."</li>
<li>We asked if they would prefer something other than drag and drop? "We want the information
	readily available or for it to be automatically considered, but drag and drop is how they do
	things now anyways"</li>
</ul>


<h4>
Part 4 -- Qualitative Assessment
</h4>
<ul>
<li>"We spend a lot of time when we schedule different courses, so when we offer multiple sections,
we want to make sure they are staggered so that a student can have multiple options. We currently
write it on a sheet of paper for the possibilities."</li>
<li>"We make sure that students that have to take courses together that they are offered at varying
times"</li>
<li>"If you move a course to a time where a professor can't teach it, what happens?"" We explained that
there is a warning about it and it won't let you schedule</li> 
<li>"We have to schedule the smart room by individuals, not by the course. Might want the preference
	for that to be at an instructor level, and not a course level"</li>
<li>"Make sure that the different level courses don't conflict (e.g. 100 level vs. 200)"</li>
<li>"We would like to see a filter for the different courses that might be in conflict"</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Final Comments
</h4>
They would use the product if it was available and working.
<br>
"We do things that way anyway so this would be very useful. We use magnets and drag and drop on a whiteboard to do this 
manually."
<br>
"As long as it saves time, then it would be useful. If it works, then yeah we will use it."
