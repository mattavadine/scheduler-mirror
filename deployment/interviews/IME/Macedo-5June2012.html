        Dr. Macedo is really interested in this software, he wants it as soon as he can get his hands on it. Dr. Fisher, I gave your email to Dr. Macedo if he has any other questions. I told him that he could use the IMEx deployment for now (because I broke the IME deployment). He may or may not be using it right now.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Macedo was interested in the algorithm. Specicially, he was concerned that a greedy algorithm was used. Because in the past, on of his master's students created and linear programming algorithm in VBA using Excel, that gave an "optimal" schedule that maximized all instructor's preferences, by giving a cumulative sum of instructor satisfaction.
        <br><br>
        He wants a way to force a specific professor to teach a course without modifying preferences.
        <br><br>
        
        Kaylene was trying to manipulate a schedule manually, through drag and drop and trying to save, ultimately "breaking" the IME deployment through data corruption.
        
        <br><br>
        He likes the drag-and-drop feature.
        <br><br>
        He likes the invalid notes/error messages. He wants to be able to manually schedule conflicted classes.
        <br><br>
        He wants it to check to make sure that faculty have a "full load". It would be helpful to see who isn't teaching their "MAX WTU" value. 
        <br><br>
        The tethered field isn't necessary for the IME department.
        <br><br>
        He wants to know when he can start using it!!!
