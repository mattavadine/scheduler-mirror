<strong>Deployment</strong> <strong>Plan</strong>
</font>
</p>

<p>
The Scheduler project may be deployed in one of two deliverables: a web-based application
and a desktop application. The current plan is to move forward with the development
of each app, and test the various methods of deployment. The prototype team is also looking
into the possibility of developing one application that supports both web and desktop 
applications.
</p></br>

<strong>Web-Based Application</strong>
<p>
Deployment process requires a supported web browser and login credentials. A user
would follow the link to web app and have access to everything in the prototype.
<p><u>Pros</u></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Simple deployment process: as long as the user has a supported browser, it will
work as expected.
<li type=disc>Available anywhere without the installation of software other than a browser.
<li type=disc>Updates are automatically applied to the site without any new installation
required of the user.
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>Cons</u></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Requires active connection to the internet at the time of use.
<li type=disc>Need to determine which browsers to support, possibly supporting at least 3 
different browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome.
<li type=disc>Updated versions of browsers may require more maintenance of the code.
</ul>
</p></br>

<strong>Desktop Application</strong>
<p>
Deployment process includes the installation of a .jar or .exe for the client to 
run. This process may need to include installation of java and any external server
software.
</p>
<p><u>Pros</u></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>More control over the environment the customer will use the program in.
<li type=disc>Installation process can include java and SQL installations to ensure successful product deployment.
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>Cons</u></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li type=disc>Need to install a supported version of java.
<li type=disc>Updates require delivery of a new executable file and installation process.
</ul>
</p>
