The files .restore-backup-db.csh and .rm-stable-dbs.csh must be installed in
the following directory on the machine running the scheduler tomcat server:

    /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/

In the current deployment, the machine running tomcat is the VM at
scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu.  In a deployed department installation, the machine
would be the one designated as the server for the department.
