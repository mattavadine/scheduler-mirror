- Changed InstructorTimePreferences class to use hashes instead of arraylists.
- Fixed some typos in the Instructor class and InstructorDB class
- Now when the database cannot be reached, the local databases will be filled
  with empty data. Also the fields under the Database dropdown are disabled
  when this occurs. If a user tries to access them, they will receive an error
  message.
- I made the ScheduleUI class static in order to implement the error messages
  described in the last bullet.
