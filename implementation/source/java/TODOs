- Add/Edit course dialog needs to update when preferences are added to the PDB
  DONE
- Edit Course dialog needs place for preferences
  DONE
- Instructor TimePrefs are off-by-one (i.e. Tuesdays affect Mondays, etc.)
  [Note: We talked about this online 8-26-10]
- Probably need separate GUI's for changing local vs. global prefs...right now, 
  one class just changes both.

- Preference windows needs to update when opened from file
- Investigate differences in local vs. global PDB, as I don't think they're 
  fully separate yet
- Remove weights from DFC, as they're stuck on Courses now
- Make local vs. global PDB views
- Decide which "PreferencesUI.java" we're going to use, the one in 
  "scheduler.db.preferencesdb", or "scheduler.db.admin.admin_ui"
