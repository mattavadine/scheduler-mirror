#
# This is a template Makefile to be put in the implementation/source/java
# directory of a 309 project.  Goto the line labeled "FILL IN HERE" to
# customize this template for your project.
#
# In order for this Makefile to work properly, your project directory must be
# set up per the 309 SOP, Volume 1.  In particular, you must have the following
# directories defined:
#
#   DIRECTORY                        CONTENTS
#   =====================================================================
#   implementation/source/java       root directory for the .java source files
#                                    of your project, organized into packages
#
#   implementation/executables/JVM   root directory for the .class executable
#                                    files generated by the Java compiler


# CSC 309 java lib directory
LIB309 =       csc309libs.jar 

# Directory for generated executable files
EXECUTABLES =   ../../executables/JVM

### FILL IN HERE:
# On lines following "FILES = \" below, fill in the names of all the Java
# source files for your project.  Each line should be of the form:
#
#    PACKAGE_DIR/*.java
#

# where "PACKAGE_DIR" is the name of one of your project packages.  Start each
# line with one tab character and end each line except the last with a space
# followed by a backslash.
