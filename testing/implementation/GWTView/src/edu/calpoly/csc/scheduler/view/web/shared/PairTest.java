/****
 *
 * This is skeleton testing class for Pair.java.  The path to this testing
 * class parallels exactly the path to the class under test.  I.e., the full
 * path to Pair.java is
 *
 *     scheduler/testing/implementation/GWTView/src/
 *         edu/calpoly/csc/scheduler/view/web/shared/PairTest.java
 *
 * The full path to this file, PairTest.java, is
 *
 *     scheduler/testing/testing/implementation/GWTView/src/
 *         edu/calpoly/csc/scheduler/view/web/shared/PairTest.java
 *
 * There is a considerable amount of superfluous directory structure in these
 * paths.  This can be cleaned when and if there is an overall refactoring of
 * the project repository.
