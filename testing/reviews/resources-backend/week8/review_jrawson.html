<strong>2. Javadoc Is Not Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<p>
	No javadocs completed for the code.

3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<p>
	Some code still needs to be completed. New methods that were added are not fully covered in tests.
	Overall design of the inner classes/implementations of the methods look strong and consistent
	with the inner tables of SQLdb.java.

<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font>
<p>
	Some tests are passing, but none of the tests are passing in full. It is getting better and the 
	amount of tests passing is increasing.
