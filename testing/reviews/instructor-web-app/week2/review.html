<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong>
</a>
</font>
<br>
InstructorsView<br>
-The method afterPush() has more than 50 lines.<br>
<br>
InstructorPreferencesView<br>
- It contains package public variables.<br>
- The method afterPush() has more than 50 lines.<br>
<br>
InstructorTimePreferencesWidget<br>
- It does not use this.X in places.  ie. line 41 this.add(list) list should have a this.<br>
- A number of If statments in setMultiplePreferences() and redraw() are put on 1 line.<br>
<br>
NoCourseDialog<br>
- Looks good<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<br>
InstructorsView<br>
- No Javadocs for anything<br>
<br>
InstructorPreferencesView<br>
- No Javadocs for anything<br>
<br>
InstructorTimePreferencesWidget<br>
- No Javadocs for anything<br>
<br>
NoCourseDialog<br>
- It has a basic class javadoc.  The NoCourseDialog() javadoc lists 3 parameters but only takes 2.<br>
<br>

3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<br>
InstructorsView<br>
- Blocks of commented code do not have reasons for comments with them<br>
- The method preferencesButtonClicked() handles failure with a print line of "ABANDON SHIP CAPTAIN"<br>
- It ideally should handle errors first and exit early.<br>
<br>
InstructorPreferencesView<br>
- Blocks of commented code do not have reasons for comments with them<br>
- It used to implement an interface.  The interface portion is still there, just commented out with no reasons given.<br>
- Uses magic numbers.<br>
- IViewContents interface methods (afterViewPoppedFromAboveMe, etc.) are mostly empty with no explainations given. The method canPop() always returns true with no explaination as to why.<br>
<br>
InstructorTimePreferencesWidget<br>
- The method onLoad() has a variable called "topStuff", which is not descriptive<br>
- Stylenames of "Rightness" and "Centerness" could be more descriptive<br>
- In method redraw(), the variable name "desire" is vague.  Desire appears to be instructor desire level to teach at a certain time.<br>
- Uses magic numbers<br>
<br>
NoCourseDialog<br>
- Looks good<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font>
<br>InstructorsView<br>
- No tests found<br>
<br>
InstructorPreferencesView<br>
- InstructorPreferencesTest did not seem to be recognized by Junit.<br>
- InstructorPreferencesTest SimpleDB passes<br>
<br>
InstructorTimePreferencesWidget<br>
- No test<br>
<br>
NoCourseDialog<br>
- No test<br>
