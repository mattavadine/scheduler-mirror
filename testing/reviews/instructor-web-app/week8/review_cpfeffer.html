<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong>
</a>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>looks good, except that sometimes the "this" is missing,
        but there is no other way around it, because otherwise it
        would not work with local anonymous classes...</li>
    <li>there are no strange printlns anymore :-D</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<br>
<i>The following issues are not only for you Jake, as well for me, but I found it hard
to differ between you code and my code...</i>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>InstructorsHomeView.java has no javadocs</li>
    <li>InstructorPreferencesView: javadoc for the following methods is missing:<br/>
        public void afterPush()<br/>
        public void setParent(com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Window parent)<br/>
        public void setInstructor(InstructorGWT instructor)<br/>
        public void setDocument(CachedOpenWorkingCopyDocument doc)<br/>
        public boolean canPop()<br/>
        public void beforePop()<br/>
        public void beforeViewPushedAboveMe()<br/>
        public void afterViewPoppedFromAboveMe()<br/>
        public Widget getContents()<br/>
        </li>
    <li>docstrings for InstructorDataSource.java are missing</li>
    <li>docstrings for InstructorsView.java are missing</li>
    <li>most of the docstrings in TimePrefsWidget.java are missing</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>3. Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>More or less - there hasn't changed that much, just small bugfixes and deletion of duplicated code</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong></font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>If the document is not saved before opening the instructor preferences window,
        the course preferences will not show up</li>
    <li>The preferences window has a strange size issue</li>
</ul>
