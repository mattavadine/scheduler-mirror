<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong></a>
</font><br />
Member names should not have 'm'<br />
Members should always be accessed with this. modifier<br />
Many members and methods are out of order in both selenium tests and in CalendarListView<br />
Not using tab indentation<br />
Didn't want to count lines, but a few methods may be over 50.

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font><br />
Poorly documented. Definitely needs more JavaDoc comments!

3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font><br />
No major design flaws.

<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font><br />
Selenium tests fail at times, but it might just be my machine.<br />
Seems to be a problem with the section numbers on the list view.<br />
It would be nice if drag and drop worked on the list view, but NBD at this point in development.
