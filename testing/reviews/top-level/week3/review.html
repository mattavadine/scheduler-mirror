<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong>
</a>
</font>
<br>
CSVTest.java is the only file modified since week 2. Some Design and Implementation Conventions that it violates are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Some methods exceed 50 line maximum.
    <li>Although some of the methods begin with the word, "test," not all of them do. I'm not sure if they need to though because they seem to "generate" data for the other tests perhaps.
    <li>There are also a lot of unused imports, but I guess that doesn't matter too much.
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<br>
CSVTest.java
<ul>
    <li>Not all methods have javadocs, but the ones that do seem to have good javadocs.
    <li>The main class description at the top states that it is a "skeleton class," but the class now contains more than just stubbed test methods. Might want to change the class description.
</ul>
<br>
<br>

3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<br>
CSVTest.java
<ul>
    <li>Some imports are unnecessary (like BufferedReader,
        FileOutputStream, LinkedList and Vector), it's ok if that's just for the moment, because
        the class is not finished yet, but when the class is finished, the needless exports should be removed</li>
    <li>the method <i>testExportCase</i> is completely commented out
        (but maybe that's just because it doesn't work yet, but in this case it would be better to comment the method header too
        or add a "fail" to the method that the method body may not be forgotten)</li>
    <li>The class should not contain a main method</li>
    <li>There are some warnings because of unused variables and methods. Those should be resolved for the final version
        (especially the unused method, if it remained from an older version of this file)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font>
CSVTest.java
<ul>
    <li>CSVTest is a test class</li>
    <li>Both tests <i>"testExport"</i> and <i>"testDayPrefs"</i> finished successfully without any error.
