<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong>
</a>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Naming conventions seem to be ok</li>
    <li>Some methods throughout the files exceed the 50-line maximum, but doesn't seem too bad</li>
    <li>Design seems ok overall</li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Completely javadoc'd files: CSVTest.java</li>
    <li>Almost completely javadoc'd files: CSVExporter.java</li>
    <li>Javadocs much needed: CSVStructure.java, CSVDownload.java, UploadService.java</li>
</ul>
<br>
<font size=+2>
3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>CSVImporter.java is completely commented out</li>
    <li>Might want to add a modifier to the CSVStructure.java class (i.e. make the class "public" or "private"... probably "public").</li>
</ul>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>CSV stuff didn't seem to actually be implemented fully in our project</li>
</ul>
