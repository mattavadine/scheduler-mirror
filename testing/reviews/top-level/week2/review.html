<strong>1. Code Follows
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/406/handouts/design-imple-conventions.html">
Design and Implementation Conventions</strong>
</a>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>ScheduleTrashView.java and SelectScheduleView.java have some tab spacing issues</li>
    <li>naming conventions seem to be ok</li>
    <li>The constructors for ScheduleTrashView.java and SelectScheduleView.java are ginormous</li>
    <li>Some methods throughout the files exceed the 50-line maximum. At this point in the project, I think it's a waste of time to worry about that stuff</li>
    <li>Almost no view files end with the "UI" suffix, but at this point, that would also be a waste of time to fix</li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>2. Javadoc Is Complete and Follows Design and Implementation
Conventions</strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Javadoc Comments above the classes are missing in all files except CSVExporter.java</li>
    <li>comments needed for various methods and variables throughout the files</li>
</ul>
<br>
<font size=+2>
3. <strong>Design of the Code is Good</strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>CSVImporter.java is completely commented out</li>
    <li>Might want to add a modifier to the CSVStructure.java class (i.e. make the class "public" or "private"... probably "public").</li>
</ul>
<br>
<font size=+2>
<strong>4. Code Passes Its Tests and Has Sensible User-Level Behavior </strong>
</font>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>SelectScheduleView.java passes usability tests, but if you create a new schedule,
        it doesn't show up in the schedule list until you refresh the browser.</li>
</ul>
