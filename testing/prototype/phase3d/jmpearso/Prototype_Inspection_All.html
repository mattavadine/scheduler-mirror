			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>Click column headers.</td>
				<td>The first click should sort the column in ascending order, and a second click should sort in descending order.</td>
				<td>FIX</td>
				<td>Sorting uses a naive ASCII-ordering approach; at the least, it should be case-insensitive.</td>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>Click column headers.</td>
				<td>An arrow or other visual indication should alert the user of the current sort direction.</td>
				<td>FIX</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>Click column headers.</td>
				<td>When a tie in sorts appears (due to multiple rows having the same value in that column), sorting should be done by the previous sort.</td>
				<td>FIX</td>
				<td>Whatever order is used for ties appears to be deterministic, but not anything apparent to me.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>Click headers of columns for which sorting makes no sense (e.g. "Preferences").</td>
				<td>Nothing should happen.</td>
				<td>FIX</td>
				<td>Indeed, nothing hapens.  However, it'd be best for the column headers to not be clickable at all.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>Click and drag a column border as small as possible.</td>
				<td>Columns should not be able to be resized so small that the user cannot resize them large again.</td>
				<td>PASS</td>
				<td></td>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>Scroll down the page far enough that the top of the table is off the page.</td>
				<td>The header should float and "follow" the user.</td>
				<td>FIX</td>
				<td>Only once it gets all the way off-screen does the header snap back down into a fully-visible position; it should do this as soon as the top of it hits the top of the screen.

				<td>A dialog should open that allows the user to edit and save the instructor's preferences.</td>
