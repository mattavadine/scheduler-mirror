      An empty row at the bottom of the list of instructors where I can input 
      new instructor information. After data is entered and the 'Enter' key is
      hit, the added row should look like the other rows in the table.
      </td>

      The row added initially has a 'Save' button. When I hit 'Enter' on the 
      keyboard, this changes to 'Edit'. I would suggest removing the 'Save' 
      button and automatically add a row if 1) A user hits 'Enter', or 2) A 
      user moves the mouse's focus away from the row.
