File -> New multiple times
    <td valign=top>
Should ask to save first or have multiple instances open
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
Looks to somewhat approach the multiple instances option, but the File menu bar begins to duplicate "Instructors Locations Courses Schedule" for each New. Only the far-right most set actually changes the view, but the preloaded data is missing.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2
    <td valign=top>
Click on any of the course data cells under Courses and then click away
    <td valign=top>
Should look just like before
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
That course's row ends up being marked as modified even though none of the fields were actually changed.
