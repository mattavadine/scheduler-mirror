Click the 'new' button
    <td valign=top>
A new green row appears for editing
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
An error box appears with "value not in options". This should not appear.

    <td valign=top>
The row is highlighted red, then removed
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>4
    <td valign=top>
Click the 'X' button to delete a new record
    <td valign=top>

    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
If two classes are added at once, then 'X' is clicked on the first course, it will remove the wrong course, after which the button fails to remove the last entry. It also performs the deletion immediately, allowing accidental erasure. Please fix.

<h3>General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 'save all' button usually does not do anything. It seems to succeed only in saving new entries.
