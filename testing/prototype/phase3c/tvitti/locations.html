Click 'new', enter data, click 'save all'
    <td valign=top>
A new location is added to the database

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2
    <td valign=top>
Use tab and shift-tab to move between data columns while editing
    <td valign=top>
Selected field changes with each press
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
Columns change size violently when selected. Shift-tab does not work.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>3
    <td valign=top>
Edit a row, then click 'save all' to commit
    <td valign=top>
Row highlights yellow, then saves data and returns to white
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
Row turns yellow even if no data is changed
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>4
    <td valign=top>
Click 'x' to delete existing row, then click 'save all'
    <td valign=top>
Row turns red to show pending deletion, then dissapears
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
Row does not delete
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>5
    <td valign=top>
Create a new row, then click 'x' to delete it, then click 'save all'
    <td valign=top>
Row turns green, then red to show pending deletion, then dissapears
    <td valign=top>
Fail
    <td valign=top>
Row is deleted immediately. Perhaps this is desired behavior? Makes it too easy to accidently delete data.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>6
    <td valign=top>
Create multiple new rows, then click 'x' to delete one
    <td valign=top>
The correct row is deleted

Pass

<h3>General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Columns changing size upon selection is very disorienting. Please disable.
<li>On a slow network connection (ie, CalPoly) there is no indication of progress when 'save all' is clicked. Operations are not performed but the application is still usable, implying failure
</ul>
