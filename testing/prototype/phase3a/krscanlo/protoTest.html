  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Case No.</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>User Inputs and Command</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Expected Output</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Remarks</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Results</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		1
    <td valign=top>
		Click the new button on the Courses table	
    <td valign=top>
		A new row pops up so that I can enter in data
    <td valign=top>
		A new row opened with default values
    <td valign=top>PASS
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2
    <td valign=top>
		Fill in Row with bogus data
    <td valign=top>
		An error that tells me that my data is invalid, and an inability to save that bogus data in the database
    <td valign=top>	
		I was able to save bogus data by not clicking outside the table but instead clicking directly on the "Save All" button
    <td valign=top>FAIL
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		3
    <td valign=top>
		Click on an X next to one of the rows 
    <td valign=top>
		A row will be delete from the view table and the database once I press save	
    <td valign=top>This worked
    <td valign=top>PASS
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		4
    <td valign=top>
		Make a lecture course have a lab by clicking on the lab dropdown
    <td valign=top>
		Once I press save, the lab section for a lecture will save to the database
    <td valign=top>There are issues with this, you can't save a course as a Lab, and you cant designate a Lab for a lecture because labs are essentially broken, therefore they don't save to the database
    <td valign=top>FAIL
