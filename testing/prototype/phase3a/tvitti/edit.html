<h3>General notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>New schedule has populated courses. Should be a blank calendar.
<li>No available courses are shown, but home screen does not provide the ability to add courses before creating a new schedule.
<li>Fake schedule shows red classes, not adhering to requirements slides.
<li>Newly created schedule name does not display in top-level dropdown as current schedule.
<li>Gridlines are confusing and differing in count, size, and spacing. Should be standardized, as per requirements.
</ul>
