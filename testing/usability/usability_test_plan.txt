Usability Plan:
--Have 402 class (and clients) attempt to do common tasks.
--Set up the testing in the usability lab.

Preliminary Testing:
--This is not testing a finished product, so we can make "drastic" changes to
the UI as needed.
--Once we finish testing the prototype, such drastic UI changes should not take
place.
--Run as many tests as necessary to get the right data we need for the
prototype.

Sample Tasks:
--Create a new schedule. (Use a template).
--Add a new professor to the roster. (Add to a specific department).
--Find a class at a given time, and see which other professors teach it.
(Same department).
--Add a new section of the class with the new professor that was just added. We
can have them add themselves to the teacher roster, just to make it easy.

Data we will record:
--How long it takes to perform tasks
--Clickmap of how people navigate the site

I don't think we need to use multiple views. Something we can just do is let
them set which kind of schedule view they like, and then see which one people
like the most, or code multiple schedule views in.
