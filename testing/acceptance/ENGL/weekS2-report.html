Instructors Page:
After hitting 'New', the cursor should focus on the last name box.
The preference box should display center-screen.
I should have not to scroll down to reach the 'Close' button on the prefrences box.
The preference box will update only if you change the status to 'Acceptable' or something else in that drop down.
The columns of the instructors grid show up in the preferences window.

Courses Page:
The drop down box for the course type seems messed up.

Could not generate schedule, however the calendar and list views of the schedule both display things fine. The drag and drop from the available
courses lists to the calendar works fine. The bottom button bar seems to work fine and the list view and calendar
view can be toggled back and forth easily.

Usability is sorely lacking on this application. The interface is clunky and hard to use.

<p>
There should be a confirmation dialog when deleting a schedule.

Cursor should be focused on text box after the create new schedule button is pressed.
Pressing 'Enter' should press the Create button on the popup

Label in top right reads "Winter%202012" instead of "Winter 2012"

There should be a tap order on all of the pages
