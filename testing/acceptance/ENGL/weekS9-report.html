Just a tip, it should have a confirmation dialog when tyring to delete a schedule.

This is actually working really well. My only beef is that it allows me to save rows that have errors. It also allows me to save empty rows.

Oh, and also, if I select multiple rows, the dialog should use "these courses" instead of "this course".

When I navigated to this page the first time, the calendar wouldn't appear properly. So I logged off and logged back in. It worked fine after this. However,
the calendar page does not respect the "scheduleable" property on the resources.

Usability is sorely lacking on this application. The interface is clunky and hard to use.

If you leave the window idle for a while dialogs about "failed to send updates to server" start to appear.

I would NOT use this application.
