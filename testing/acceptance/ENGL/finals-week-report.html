These grids have been much improved upon since the beginning of the quarter. They have slowly been getting better and now they are at a point where I would
happily use them.

Two small complaints:
1. It lets me save resource data for which I have not entered in a name, for instance a course with no number or dept.
2. The "Successfully saved" dialog is annoying. Upon successfully saving I should receive no dialog but the little star next to the
document name should still go away to indicate successfully saving.

The calendar and the list both worked well! I successfully dragged and edited several items.

I got several server errors when I tried to save after generating and editing the schedule.

Also, "Ctrl-S" needs to be hooked up so I can save more easily.

There should be a confirmation dialog when deleting a schedule.

I couldn't log back in after teesting the app. "Couldn't get documents"

I would use this application as an aid, but I would not rely on it.
