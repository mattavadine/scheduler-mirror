Just a tip, it should have a confirmation dialog when tyring to delete a schedule. Also, it should open the schedule in the same tab and window.

Instructors Page:
After hitting 'New' the page throws an uncaught exception because of the course type.
After hitting 'New', the cursor should focus on the last name box for instructors and the deparment box for courses.

The intructors table allows me to enter in blank instructors??

After a course is entered, and I try to double click a column to edit it, a casting exception appears.

Double clicking the username column does not work.

The preference box should display center-screen.
I should have not to scroll down to reach the 'Close' button on the prefrences box.
The preference box will update only if you change the status to 'Acceptable' or something else in that drop down.
The columns of the instructors grid show up in the preferences window.

Tabbing seems to work....but it's very slow.

There are so many exceptions being thrown that entering resources is very time consuming. THIS IS UNUSABLE.

The calendar and list of available courses did not even appear when I navigated to the schedule tab the first time. I had to hit refresh. When I toggle
between the list and calendar view, the CSS messed up because the list and calendar collapse to the left of the page. Matt and I are aware of this and working on it.

Could not generate schedule. I get a failed to generate schedule 500 server error pop up. This message should be more user-friendly.

Could not generate schedule, however the calendar and list views of the schedule both display things fine. The drag and drop from the available
courses lists to the calendar works fine. The bottom button bar seems to work fine and the list view and calendar
view can be toggled back and forth easily.

Usability is sorely lacking on this application. The interface is clunky and hard to use.

There should be a confirmation dialog when deleting a schedule.

Cursor should be focused on text box after the create new schedule button is pressed.
Pressing 'Enter' should press the Create button on the popup

Label in top right reads "Winter%202012" instead of "Winter 2012"

There should be a tap order on all of the pages


Intermittent 500 errrors.

I would NOT use this application.
