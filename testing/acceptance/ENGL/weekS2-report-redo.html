This mostly works now. 
The scheduleable checkbox is broken on the instructors list.
I would still prefer that the first column is already focused upon hitting the "New item" button for the courses and instructors.

When I hit generate the calendar and list view do not draw correctly (they snap to the far left). The loading gif does not go away.

Usability is sorely lacking on this application. The interface is clunky and hard to use.

<p>
There should be a confirmation dialog when deleting a schedule.

Cursor should be focused on text box after the create new schedule button is pressed.
Pressing 'Enter' should press the Create button on the popup

Label in top right reads "Winter%202012" instead of "Winter 2012"

There should be a tap order on all of the pages


Intermittent 500 errrors.
