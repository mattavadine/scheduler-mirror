<strong>Spring Finals Week Acceptance Test Report for the MU Department</strong>
</font>
</p>
<br>
<h2>
Browser Used for Testing: Used Sellenium Testing for data entry with Chrome. <br>
This test was done as of 1:30pm on Monday, so the latest changes were not deployed
which should fix some of the schedule issues.
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule">
<h2>
1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Able to login using "admin" and create, save and re-open the schedule.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Enter Resource Data">
<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Data entry was mostly very good.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I tried to associate a lecture with a lab, and could not click on the association column.
		I then logged out and back in, and all courses had an association with the first course
		in the column. I still could not click on this to update it. I am not sure if this is
		affecting generate or not.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Generate a Schedule">
<h2>
3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Successfully generated a schedule. 
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The schedule looked great in the list and calendar view, however there was an overlap in the courses
		that were being taught by the professor. He was scheduled for 3 overlapping courses.</li>
	<li>When I logged out and opened the schedule again, there was no generated schedule. Had to generate again</li>
	<li>I tried generating a schedule while looking at the List View, and it didn't do anything</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Edit the Schedule">
<h2>
4.  Edit the Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Moving courses around on the schedule with drag and drop was successful.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It would be nice to have more clear information about a course when moving and scheduling,
		such as hours per week and day combinations. There was a popup for hours per week
		when I tried to schedule a course for the incorrect number of hours.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">
<h2>
5.  Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Saving worked (nice popup). When I logged out and back in, I was able to see the same schedule
document and open it back up again.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I did not see the same generated schedule after logging out and back in.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Quality Measures">
<h2>
6.  Quality Measures
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Generally the product looks good. In random user tests, the look and feel was functional/familiar.
Able to generate a schedule and enter resources successfully.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Location of the Generate Schedule button is still hard for most people to find</li>
	<li>The schedule was not valid since there was an overlap in courses.</li>
	<li>Schedule does not look very clean with lots of courses. This was an issue we did not
		get to address since we only recently got a working Generate Schedule button.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Other Issues">
<h2>
7.  Other Issues
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>After running Selenium tests with MU resources, Generate Schedule button caused a 500 error after entering resources.</li>
	<li>Navigated to courses table after generating, tried to save, received 500 error. Navigating to any tab after this
		also resulted in a 500 error.</li>
	<li>I logged out and tried to log back in as admin and received "Failed to get documents". It could not log me back
		in after this. This issue happened after the above mentioned issue with the 500 error.</li>
</ul>
