<p>
Successfully created Winter 2012 schedule. 

<br><br><b>Issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>Had to logout to see schedule in the home screen, new Document page did not
open when clicking Create</li>
<li>Created schedule named "Test". Refreshed home. Deleted "Test". Tried to make
"Test" again, and it said the name already existed. After logging out and back
in, I could then create "Test" again.</li>
<li>Schedule name has a space which is appearing as %20 in title of open document</li>
</ul>

2.  Enter Resource Data

<p>
<b>Things that worked:</b>
<ul>
<li>Tabbed data entry</li>
<li>Ordering the columns by clicking on the top row</li>
<li>Saving, exiting, and reopening a schedule with same data</li>
</ul>

<br><b>Issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>Had to double click Day Combinations column in order to see checkboxes</li>
<li>After selecting a Day Combo, the column would compress and I would have to double
click again</li>
<li>Reopening the schedule results in all data being gone without force saving. 
*I thought we were autosaving?</li>
<li>Unable to edit text in a cell that has already been entered. Only able to replace
existing text</li>
<li>Unable to delete a row. I don't see a way to do this</li>
<li>Unable to save association for a class. Appears as "None" after saving</li>
<li>Missing day combination for MTWF</li>
<li>When tabbing to input values, the view jumps to the top of the page. Need
to scroll down to see where I am inputting values</li>
<li>I do not see a way to support ACTivities that do not have times associated with them,
so I have left them out of the course resources</li>
<li>Had a 500 error, failed to update server</li>
<li>Update failed: 502, Bad Gateway</li>
<li>After these errors occurred, saving did not work. I was told data had saved,
but upon reopening, it had not been</li>
<li>It is unclear how to crosslist courses. I do not see how to list MU 171 and MU 371
as the same course to be scheduled at the same time</li>
<li>Shift+tab makes new row instead of going back a tab</li>
<li>Scrolling sideways while the column headers are moving down with the top of the page
results in the columns moving, but the headers staying fixed</li>
</ul>
