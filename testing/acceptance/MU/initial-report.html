<strong>Initial Report on Generating Winter 2012 Schedule for MU
Department</strong>

</p>
<br>
<h3>
Entering Resource Data
</h3>
<p>
<u>Good</u>
<ul>
<li>Tabbed navigation and enter worked as expected.</li>
<li>When editing, the images to the left of the row successfully changed between
pencil/red x and checkmark.</li>
</ul>
<u>Issues</u>
<ul>
<li>There is no way to enter an ACT or IND type in the schedule.</li>
<li>Labs cannot be associated with a lecture, and they are not stored as labs
when refreshing the tab.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Generating a Schedule
</h3>
<p>
<u>Good</u>
<ul>
<li>All of the classes from the Courses tab were scheduled, but they
did not have specific professors associated with a course.</li>
</ul>
<u>Issues</u>
<ul>
<li>Preferences are not working right now, so all classes were scheduled at 
7am MWF.</li>
<li>Classes were not scheduled for the appropriate amount of hours. Classes
that are supposed to be 1 hour or 4 hours a week were all offered MWF 7-8am.</li>
<li>Schedule generation took around 15-20 seconds, and the loading wheel animation
froze partway through.
<li>Courses that are crosslisted, such as MU 171 and MU 371, cannot be scheduled
at the same time, even though they are essentially the same course.
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Editing the Schedule
</h3>
<p>
<u>Good</u>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop works, although sluggish.</li>
<li>Moving a course successfully updates the schedule and information about
a scheduled item.</li>
</ul>
<u>Issues</u>
<ul>
<li>Editing the schedule is extremely sluggish (taking about 15-20 seconds 
to refresh the view when moving an item).</li>
<li>There is no way to cancel the movement of a schedule item after dragging
to a new cell</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Other Issues
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The "New" button is always at the top of the page for resource management.
This is very cumbersome when the page is full and you have to scroll to the top
in order to create a new row.
</ul>
