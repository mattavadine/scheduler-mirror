<a name="Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule">
<h2>
1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Able to login using "admin" and create, save and re-open the schedule.
</p>

<a name="Enter Resource Data">
<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Location and Instructor entry was solid.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Day Combinations were not 100%. When I modified the SCU, a red checkmark appeared next to my day
		combination selection</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Generate a Schedule">
<h2>
3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Unable to generate a schedule using the "Generate Schedule" button. Loading gif came up after pressing the button, and 
a 500 error popped up.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Edit the Schedule">
<h2>
4.  Edit the Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Moving courses around on the schedule with drag and drop was successful.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>When dragging a course onto the schedule, it is unclear how many hours a week the course is supposed to be scheduled
		and what day combinations are valid. The window that pops up should have more info about the course I am manually
		placing on the schedule.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">
<h2>
5.  Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Saving worked (nice popup). When I logged out and back in, I was able to see the same schedule
and open it back up again.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Quality Measures">
<h2>
6.  Quality Measures
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Generally the product looks good. In random user tests, the look and feel was functional/familiar.
</p>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Location of the Generate Schedule button is hard for most people to find</li>
	<li>The schedulable checkbox confused users since they thought it was the way to indicate which 
		rows were selected. They tried to delete resources by checking the box and clicking remove</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a name="Other Issues">
<h2>
7.  Other Issues
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>After running Selenium tests with MU resources, Generate Schedule button caused a 500 error after entering resources.</li>
	<li>After entering 2 courses and no instructors/locations, clicking Generate Schedule caused infinite loading gif.</li>
	<li>Logged out and back in, chose same schedule, clicked generate. Loading gif came up and disappeared, but nothing was on the schedule.</li>
</ul>
