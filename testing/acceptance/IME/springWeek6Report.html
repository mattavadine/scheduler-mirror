This works doesn't seem to work. After creating several courses and instructors and saving them (which yielded a "successfully saved" message), I got a "Failed to retrieve courses!!" error. In fact, I got this several times, while I was trying to change tabs. When I logged out and logged back in. After I logged back in, my "saved" document was gone.

When you drag a course onto the schedule it does not assign an instructor.

When editing, if you fill in a field as "Don't care" it should still assign a proper value to the field

    The resource tables are getting to a stable and usable place; however, work needs to be done to fix the minor bugs, and to make sure that data validation is occuring.
<p><li>
The generation page is not acceptable. I cannot press the generation button, I still get errors. And when I try to drag courses onto the schedule, it doesn't seem to be running the algorithm to assign instructors or rooms to these courses. 
<p><li>
    The top-level UI functionality doesn't seem to be working, based on the failed to retrieve documents error, we either have some serious saving issues. (Probably due to data retrieval issues).
