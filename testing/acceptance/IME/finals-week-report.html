Changing the course type does not work well
<p> <li>
It is weird that the associations tab is blank when no labs exist.
<p> <li>
The disabilities "checkbox" is unintuitive and bizarre
<p> <li>
Bug: Error saving instructor: 500 The call failed on the server; see server log for details when you try to change an instructors' time preferences
<p> <li>
When you navigate between tabs, courses should be verified as acceptable data before you navigate to a new tab
<p> <li>
Invalid courses should not be acceptable options for "Course Preferences"
<p> <li>
The equipment "popup" set of checkboxes isn't "pretty" we need to come up with a better solution

<p> <li>
"AvailableCourses" should be "Available Courses"

When an "Available Course" is dragged onto the schedule, it only scheduled a single 50 minute block even though the hours per week field is specified as "4"

When you drag a scheduled course from one time location to another, it does not "save" the Instructor data as it drags and drops, this information should be retained
<p> <li>
"AvailableCourses" should be "Available Courses"
<p> <li>
When an "Available Course" is dragged onto the schedule, it only scheduled a single 50 minute block even though the hours per week field is specified as "4"
<p> <li>
Even though a schedule course says TBA for instructor after having previously been assigned an instructor, the list view suggests that the previously assigned instructor is still the instructor

No visual indication of which "navigation tab" you are located in
<p> <li>
The file name at the top should be editable 
<p> <li>
The file and settings menu's arrows need to be refined to look better
<p> <li>
The file and settings menus should not exist on the login page, this occurs when you are logged in and then press "log out"
<p> <li>
The file and settings menus should not be available on the home page
<p> <li>
File...Open should open a completely new window/tab, not navigate directly away from the web interface
