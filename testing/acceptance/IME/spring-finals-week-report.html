This works. Except when you get data corruption from manipulating a schedule with drag and drop.

<p> <li>
The row selection (used for resource deletion/duplication) is strange, I want it to be "selected" only if they click directly on the checkbox, not on the row.
    <p><li>
It's not clear to the user whether or not max enrollment was per section or overall for the entire course
    <p><li>
        Other than that, these seem to be working well.
    <p><li>
        We should consider putting the defaults for the instructor preferences back to "Not Qualified" because it is the most common answer, compared to "Acceptable".
        
        <p><li>
            It needs to be clear that "username" is the Cal Poly, CAS username.

<ol type=a>

    Drag and drop defaults need to be more intuative. When the pop-up comes up, it should have defaults that don't give me an error message if I just press "OK".
    <p><li>
        After playing around with drag and drop, I was able to "break" the database because the "ScheduleItem" data was corrupted. This broke the entire deployment.

<em>
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Generate still spits out "gross looking" schedules with lots of classes in a single time spot
<p><li>
When editing, by default it should give a start time and and end time that amounts to an hour difference, not a 1/2 hour difference.

<ol type=a>

    The resource tables are getting to a stable and usable place; however, work needs to be done to fix the minor bugs, and to make sure that data validation is occuring, CORRECTLY at this point.
<p><li>
    Drag and drop doesn't pass the "doesn't suck test." See above for more details.
