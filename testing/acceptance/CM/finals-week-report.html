Having to double click to get the days to drop down is annoying.<p>
I entered something in the last name field, then when I tried to double-click to edit it didn't change the box to an edit text field. Also, ctrl+a selects the entire page and not just the contents of the cell.<p>
Instructor time prefs don't save.<p>
Again, double clicking in the equipment field to change stuff is gross, it should pop over to table row and not expand it. Also, it should stay open instead of closing whenever something is selected.

There's a weird space between the available courses and the top of the page. It would look ok if there was similar spacing underneath that box thing I guess.
