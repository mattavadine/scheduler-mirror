<h3>
Entering Resource Data
</h3>
<p>
I was able to enter everything without many problems. I did not input time or course preferences, though. The one problem I had was with saving a course as a LAB, which is deatailed in issue <a href="https://scheduler.atlassian.net/browse/SCHED-43">Issue 43</a> in Jira.
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Generating a Schedule
</h3>
<p>
a.  The generated schedule did contain all the classes.
<br />
b.  The algorithm scheduled all of the classes during the 7-8am time slot on MWF due to the fact preferences were not entered.
<br />
c.  No scheduling conflicts were found.
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Editing the Schedule
</h3>
<p>
I was able to perform a drag and drop to edit the generated schedule.
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Other Issues
</h3>
<p>
There is an issue with the "Loading" image, as shown in <a href="https://scheduler.atlassian.net/browse/SCHED-110">Issue 110</a> in Jira.
