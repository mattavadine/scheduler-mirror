   <li>Unable to put in single days in the Day Combinations field.  Looks like lectures and labs have different possible day combinations.</li>
   <li>One of the activities has no day or time set.  It is not possible to add this to the course table without entering a day combo and hours per week.</li>
   <li>Instructor preferences are off.  When setting prefs for 12-2pm it fills in the 12, 1, and 2 hour blocks.  Should only fill the 12 and 1.</li>
