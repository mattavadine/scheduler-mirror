<h2>
1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>1.1 Functionally works fine, but wish enter key could be used. I keep pressing it out of habit from how it's used consistently in other applications/everywhere.<br>1.2 Occasionally after creating a new schedule, doesn't let me open it or doesn't show up in the list of documents. <br>1.3 Spaces in schedule names are displayed as '%20'<br>1.4 The interaction between saving/deleting/going to deletion page, etc...the page listing scheduling documents is not intuitive to work with.<p>

2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
2.1 No support for multiple course types (sem, act, etc) in the UI.<br>2.2 Have to double-click in every field - annoying<br>2.3 500 error when entering instructor preferences<p>

3.  Generate a Schedule

3.1 When instructor preference are not saved correctly (as above error) Generate fails (propogated as 500 error). While expected, we should probably handle this case in the algorithm more gracefully.<p>
