	<h2><a name="Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule">1. Create,
	Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule</a></h2><br>
	<p>
		Everything worked as expected.  However, the title of the document
		improperly escapes spaces with the url encoding <code>%20</code>:
		<img src="finals-week-report/01.png" />
	</p>

	<h2><a name="Enter Resource Data">2. Enter Resource
	Data</a></h2><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Pressing tab to switch field scrolled the page to the top.</li>
		<li>Saving sometimes took a few seconds; during that time, there was no
		visual feedback that the save had not yet completed, so I was surprised
		when I got the alertbox telling me the schedule had been saved.</li>
		<li>Lectures and labs are the same course number - how do I
		differentiate them?  Should I list them separately, or together?  If I
		list them separately, counting the number of sections is a little
		annoying, since the section numbers increment through both lectures and
		labs.</li>
		<li>Why do I have to enter the department every time?</li>
		<li>I couldn't change the type of FSN 204 to Lab - when I tried to, it
		went back to Lecture.  Reloading the page fixed this.</li>
		<li>Dropdowns inside psuedo-Excel cells don't really work.</li>
		<li>If I have to do labs and lectures separately, why can't I duplicate
		a row?  Most of the information is the same.</li>
		<li>I can't edit text inside a cell - replace or gtfo.</li>
		<li>I don't know what "updateheaderwidths" is supposed to do, but it
		ain't doing it.</li>
		<li><strike>I'd like for there to be a keyboard method for creating a
		new row.</strike></li>
		<li>Rows look like they're draggable.  They aren't.</li>
		<li>The header stays still while scrolling the page horizontally.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="Generate a Schedule">3. Generate a
	Schedule</a></h2><br>
	<ul>
		<li>There's nothing listed under "AvailableCourses".</li>
		<li>Also, "AvailableCourses"?  Spaces, plox.</li>
		<li>Pressing the "Generate Schedule" button throws an error; the logs
		tell me this:
		<code><pre>com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.UnexpectedException: Service
		method 'public abstract java.util.Collection
		edu.calpoly.csc.scheduler.view.web.client.GreetingService.generateRestOfSchedule(int)
		throws
		edu.calpoly.csc.scheduler.view.web.shared.CouldNotBeScheduledExceptionGWT'
		threw an unexpected exception: java.lang.NullPointerException
		        at
				com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.RPC.encodeResponseForFailure(RPC.java:385)
		</pre></code></li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="Edit the Schedule">4. Edit the Schedule</a></h2><br>
	<p>
		Can't if it doesn't list any available courses.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">5. Save, Exit, Re-Open
	Schedule</a></h2><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Course items rearranged themselves once.</li>
		<li>Logging out and logging back in: first click on the schedule name
		just opened the list of schedules again in a new window.  The second
		click gave me an error: "Failed to open document: 0" or something, but
		then loaded the document after a few seconds.</li>
	</ul>
