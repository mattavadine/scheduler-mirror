\fINOTE:\fP If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you can
try to enter specific instructor preferences to ensure that one instructor gets
exactly the classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter 2012.
It would be better to enter preferences more broadly, where the actual Winter
2012 times as courses are within the preference range of the instructor who got
them.
.le
Under the heading "\fBEditing the Schedule\fP", describe how close you were
able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department, using the
Scheduler program editing functionality.  I.e., our objective here is to use
Scheduler program editing to create precisely the schedule that is published by
the department for Winter 2012.  If there were no problems, say "Winter 2012
schedule successfully produced."  If there were one or more problems, include
links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
.le
Under the heading "\fBOther Issues\fP" Describe any other problems or issues
that arose during the schedule generation process, including UI look-and-feel
and overall usability.  Include links to any Jira issues that were posted for
the problems.
