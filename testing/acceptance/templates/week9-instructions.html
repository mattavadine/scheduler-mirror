<strong>Instructions for Week 9 Acceptance Testing</strong>
</font>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A blank copy of the week 9 acceptance test report has already been put into
each department subdirectory.  It is a very simple HTML file.  You can edit the
file directly in a plain text editor, or use some form of word processor and
save it as an HTML file.  In either case, the file should have the seven
sections listed in the template.
</p><p>
The objective of this acceptance testing process is to re-create the Winter
2012 schedule that was published for your department.  The title for each
section of the report describes the actions to be performed for that section.
This is exactly the same acceptance test procedure we did earlier in the
quarter.
</p><p>
For each section of the report, if the actions can be performed 100%
successfully, then say "All actions performed successfully."  If there are any
problems, describe them clearly.  A "problem" is a bug, sub-standard
performance, or any aspect of program behavior that is not 100% satisfactory.
Post a Jira issue for any problems, if an issue for that problem has not
already been posted.
</p><p>
The following are further specific instructions for each section of the report:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<strong>Create a new schedule for Winter 2012</strong>.  Save an empty version
of that schedule and re-open it.  Use this newly-created schedule for the rest
of the testing.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong>Enter all of the necessary resource data</strong> for the Winter 2012
schedule.  This includes all instructors, courses, rooms, and preferences.
<br>
<br>
If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you can try to enter
specific instructor preferences to ensure that each instructor gets exactly the
classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter 2012 schedule.  It
would be better to enter preferences more broadly, such that Winter 2012
scheduled items are within the preference ranges, but preferences don't dictate
a particular schedule.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong>Generate the schedule</strong>.  In addition to any reported problem,
describe the quality of the schedule that was automatically generated, in
particular:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Did it contain all classes?
<p> <li>
Were they at reasonable times?
<p> <li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
</ol>
<br>
<br>
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong>Edit the generated schedule</strong> to get as close as possible to the
published Winter 2012 schedule.  Describe how close you were able to get to the
actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department, using the Scheduler program
editing functionality.  Again, our objective here is to use the Scheduler
program to create precisely the schedule that is published by the department
for Winter 2012.
<br>
<br>
After the preceding edits are done, perform some additional edits to test the
schedule editing functionality.  In particular, move courses around in the
schedule to test the incremental constraint and preference validation.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong>Save the schedule</strong>, exit the program, restart, and re-open the
saved schedule schedule.  Save a copy of the schedule on a different file,
exit, restart, and re-open both files.
<p>
<p> <li>
<strong>Describe any quality measures</strong> that were not achieved during
the preceding testing.  The quality measures are those listed under the revised
Week 5 features list in the project file:
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/matrix.html">
<tt>requirements/matrix.html</tt>.
</a>
<br>
<br>
If all quality measures are achieved satisfactorily, say "All quality measures
met."  If not all quality measures were covered during the preceding testing,
then indicate this.  For example, if you did not need to use course suffixing
for your department, say "Use of course suffixing not required for X
department."
<p> <li>
<strong>Describe any other problems or issues</strong> that were not covered in
the preceding testing steps, including overall UI look-and-feel and usability.
Include links to any new Jira issues that you post.
