<strong>Instructions for Week 9 Acceptance Testing</strong>
</font>
</p>
<br>
<br>
A blank copy of the week 9 acceptance test report has already been put into
each department subdirectory.  It is a very simple HTML file.  You can edit the
file directly in a plain text editor, or use some form of word processor and
save it as an HTML file.  In either case, the file should have the seven
sections listed in the template.
</p><p>
The objective of this acceptance testing process is to re-create the Winter
2012 schedule that was published for your department.  The title for each
section of the report describes the actions to be performed for that section.
This is exacly the same accepatance test procedure we did earlier in the
quarter.
</p><p>
For each section of the report, if the actions can be performed 100%
successfully, then say "All actions performed successfully."  If there are any
problems, describe them clearly.  A "problem" is a bug, sub-standard
performance, or any aspect of program behavior that is not 100% satisfactory.
Post a Jira issue for any problems, if an issue for that problem has not
already been posted.
</p><p>
The following are further specific instructions for each section of the report:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Create a new schedule for Winter 2012.  Save an empty version of that schedule
and re-open it.  Use this newly-created schedule for the rest of the testing.
<p>
<p> <li>
Enter all of the necessary data for the Winter 2012 schedule.  This includes
all instructors, courses, and rooms.
<p>
<p> <li>
Generate a schedule.  In addition to any problem reports, describe the quality
of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Did it contain all classes?
<p> <li>
Were they at reasonable times?
<p> <li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
</ol>
<br>
<br>
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<br>
<br>
If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you can try to enter
specific instructor preferences to ensure that one instructor gets exactly the
classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter 2012.  It would be
better to enter preferences more broadly, where the actual Winter 2012 times as
courses are within the preference range of the instructor who got them.
<p>
<p> <li>
Edit the generated schedule to get to be as close to Winter 2012 as possible.
Then perform some additional edits to test the schedule editing functionality.
Describe how close you were able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for
the department, using the Scheduler program editing functionality.  Again, our
objective here is to use the Scheduler program to create precisely the schedule
that is published by the department for Winter 2012.
<p>
<p> <li>
Save the schedule, exit the program, restart, and re-open the saved schedule
schedule.  Save a copy of the schedule on different file, exit, restart, and
re-open.
<p>
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Quality Measures</strong>", describe any quality
measures that were not achieved during the preceding testing.  The quality
measures are those listed under the revised Week 5 features list the project
file:
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/matrix.html">
requirements/matrix.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
If all quality measures are achieved satisfactorily, say "All quality measures
met."  If not all quality measures were covered during the preceding testing,
then indicate this.  For example, if you did not need to use course suffixing
for your department, say "Use of course suffixing not required for X
department."  Include links to any Jira issues that were posted for the
problems.
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Other Issues</strong>", describe any other problems
or issues that were not covered in any of the previous testing steps, including
UI look-and-feel and overall usability.  Include links to any Jira issues that
were posted for the problems.
