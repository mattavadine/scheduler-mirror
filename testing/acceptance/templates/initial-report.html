<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Fill in the appropriate department name where "X" appears above.
<p>
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Entering Resource Data</strong>", describe any
problems that arose when entering database records for instructors, courses, or
locations.  If there were no problems, say "All data successfully entered."  If
there were one or more problems, include links to the Jira issues that were
posted for the problems.  Before posting a Jira issue, search the existing
issue list and do not re-post issues for duplicate problems.
<p>
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Generating a Schedule</strong>", describe the
quality of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Did it contain all classes?
<p> <li>
Were they at reasonable times?
<p> <li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
</ol>
<br>
<br>
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<br>
<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you
can try to enter specific instructor preferences to ensure that one instructor
gets exactly the classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter
2012.  It would be better to enter preferences more broadly, where the actual
Winter 2012 times as courses are within the preference range of the instructor
who got them.
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Editing the Schedule</strong>", describe how close
you were able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department,
using the Scheduler program editing functionality.  I.e., our objective here is
to use Scheduler program editing to create precisely the schedule that is
published by the department for Winter 2012.  If there were no problems, say
"Winter 2012 schedule successfully produced."  If there were one or more
problems, include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Other Issues</strong>" Describe any other problems
or issues that arose during the schedule generation process, including UI look-
and-feel and overall usability.  Include links to any Jira issues that were
posted for the problems.
