Fill in the appropriate department name where "X" appears above.
<p>
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Entering Resource Data</strong>", describe any
problems that arose when entering database records for instructors, courses, or
locations.  There were no problems, say "All data successfully entered."
<p>
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Generating a Schedule</strong>", describe the
quality of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Did it contain all classes?
<p> <li>
Were they at reasonable times?
<p> <li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
</ol>
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Editing the Schedule</strong>", describe how close
you were able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department,
using the Scheduler program editing functionality.  I.e., you want to produce
precisely the schedule that is published by the department for Winter 2012.  If
there were no problems, say "Winter 2012 schedule successfully produced."
<p> <li>
Describe any other problems or issues that arose during the schedule generation
process.
