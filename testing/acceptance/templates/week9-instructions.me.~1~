\fBInstructions for Week 9 Acceptance Testing\fP

A blank copy of the week 9 acceptance test report has already been put into
each department subdirectory.  It is a very simple HTML file.  You can edit the
file directly in a plain text editor, or use some form of word processor and
save it as an HTML file.  In either case, the file should have the seven
sections listed in the template.
.pep
The following are specific instructions for filling each section of the report:
.(L 1
.le
Under the heading "\fBOpen an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule\fP",
describe any problems that arise when opening a new schedule or creating a new
schedule.  Use the newly created empty schedule for the rest of the testing.
.hc p
.le
Under the heading "\fBEnter Resource Data\fP", describe any problems that
arise when entering database records for instructors, courses, or locations.
If there were no problems, say "All data successfully entered."  If there were
one or more problems, include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the
problems.  Before posting a Jira issue, search the existing issue list and do
not re-post issues for duplicate problems.
.hc p
.le
Under the heading "\fBGenerate a Schedule\fP", describe the quality
of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
.(L a .2v
.le
Did it contain all classes?
.le
Were they at reasonable times?
.le
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
.)L a
.sp 1
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
.sp 1
\fINOTE:\fP If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you can
try to enter specific instructor preferences to ensure that one instructor gets
exactly the classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter 2012.
It would be better to enter preferences more broadly, where the actual Winter
2012 times as courses are within the preference range of the instructor who got
them.
.hc p
.le
Under the heading "\fBEdit the Schedule\fP", describe how close you were
able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department, using the
Scheduler program editing functionality.  I.e., our objective here is to use
Scheduler program editing to create precisely the schedule that is published by
the department for Winter 2012.  If there were no problems, say "Winter 2012
schedule successfully produced."  If there were one or more problems, include
links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
.hc p
.le
Under the heading "\fBSave, Exit, Re-Open Schedule\fP", describe any problems
that arise when saving a schedule, exiting the scheduler program entirely,
re-entering, and re-opening the saved schedule.  If there were no problems, say
"Winter 2012 successfully saved and re-opened."  If there were one or
more problems, include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the
problems.
.hc p
.le
Under the heading "\fBQuality Measures\fP", describe any quality measures that
were not achieved during the preceding testing.  The quality measures are those
listed the revised features list the project file:
.(Ah "http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/matrix.html"
requirements/matrix.html
.)Ah
.br
.br
.br
If all quality measures are
achieved satisfactorily, say "All quality measures met."  If not all quality
measures were covered during the preceding testing, then indicate this.  For
example, if you did not need to use course suffixing for your department, say
"Use of course suffixing not required for X department."  Include links to any
Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
.le
Under the heading "\fBOther Issues\fP", describe any other problems or issues
that were not covered in any of the previous testing steps, including UI
look-and-feel and overall usability.  Include links to any Jira issues that
were posted for the problems.
