<font color=red><strong><em>The following are instructions for filling in this
file; delete the instructions when done.</em></strong></font>
<ul>
<li>
Copy this template to your assigned department subdirectory in
<blockquote><pre>
testing/acceptance
</pre></blockquote>
<li>
Fill in the department name where "X" appears in the title above.
<li>
<p>
<li>
Under the heading <em>"Open an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule"</em>,
describe any problems that arise when opening a new schedule or creating a new
schedule.  Use the newly created empty schedule for the rest of the testing.
<p>
<li>
Under the heading "<strong>Enter Resource Data</strong>", describe any problems
that arise when entering database records for instructors, courses, or
locations.  If there were no problems, say "All data successfully entered."  If
there were one or more problems, include links to the Jira issues that were
posted for the problems.  Before posting a Jira issue, search the existing
issue list and do not re-post issues for duplicate problems.
<p>
<li>
Under the heading "<strong>Generate a Schedule</strong>", describe the quality
of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
<ol type=a>
<li>
Did it contain all classes?
<li>
Were they at reasonable times?
<li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
</ol>
<br>
<br>
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<br>
<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you
can try to enter specific instructor preferences to ensure that one instructor
gets exactly the classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter
2012.  It would be better to enter preferences more broadly, where the actual
Winter 2012 times as courses are within the preference range of the instructor
who got them.
<li>
Under the heading "<strong>Edit the Schedule</strong>", describe how close you
were able to get to the actual Winter 2012 schedule for the department, using
the Scheduler program editing functionality.  I.e., our objective here is to
use Scheduler program editing to create precisely the schedule that is
published by the department for Winter 2012.  If there were no problems, say
"Winter 2012 schedule successfully produced."  If there were one or more
problems, include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
<li>
Under the heading "<strong>Quality Measures</strong>", describe any quality
measures that were not achieved during the preceding testing.  The quality
measures are those listed the revised features list the project file:
<a href="http:scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/matrix.html">
requirements/matrix.html
</a>
<br>
If all quality measures are achieved satisfactorily, say "All quality measures
met."  If not all quality measures were covered during the preceding testing,
then indicate this.  For example, if you did not need to use course suffixing
for your department, say "Use of course suffixing not required for X
department."  Include links to any Jira issues that were posted for the
problems.
<p> <li>
Under the heading "<strong>Other Issues</strong>", describe any other problems
or issues that were not covered in any of the previous testing steps, including
UI look-and-feel and overall usability.  Include links to any Jira issues that
were posted for the problems.
