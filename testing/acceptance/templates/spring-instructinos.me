There is a simple report template in the file
.(Ah "http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/testing/acceptance/templates/report.html"
\fCtesting/acceptance/templates/report.html\fP,
.)Ah
Suppose you are performing acceptance testing during week N for department X.
Make a copy of \fCtemplates/report.html\fP into X/weekSN-report.html.  For
example, if you're doing acceptance testing during week 3 for the CHEM
department, do this in the \fCtesting/acceptance\fP directory:
.(n
\fCcp templates/report.html CHEM/weekS3-report.html\fP
.)n
To perform your acceptance testing:
.(L 1 .3v
.le
svn update your working project directory
.le
fill in the file \fCfinals-week-report.html\fP
.le
commit the file when you're done.
.)L 1
.pep
The report template is a very simple HTML file.  You can edit the file directly
in a plain text editor, or use some form of word processor and save it as an
HTML file.  In either case, make sure you fill in all seven sections of the
report.
.pep
Before putting in the actual acceptance content, do the following clerical
edits:
.(E .2v
.ee
replace "N" with the week number
.ee
replace "X" with the department ID
.ee
fill in the name of the browser you use during the test -- Firefox, Safari,
Chrome, or IE
.)E
.pep
The objective of this acceptance testing process is to re-create the Winter
2012 schedule that was published for your department.  The title for each
section of the report describes the actions to be performed for that section.
This is exactly the same acceptance test procedure we did earlier in the
quarter.
.pep
For each section of the report, if the actions can be performed 100%
successfully, then say "All actions performed successfully."  If there are any
problems, describe them clearly.  A "problem" is a bug, sub-standard
performance, or any aspect of program behavior that is not 100% satisfactory.
Post a Jira issue for any problems, if an issue for that problem has not
already been posted.
.pe

.uh "Details for Each Section of the Report" 2
.pp
The following are further specific instructions for each section of the report:
.(L 1 .6v
.le
\fBCreate a new schedule for Winter 2012\fP.  Save an empty version of that
schedule and re-open it.  Use this newly-created schedule for the rest of the
testing.
.hc p
.le
\fBEnter all of the necessary resource data\fP for the Winter 2012 schedule.
This includes all instructors, courses, rooms, and preferences.
.sp .6v
If you want to force the generation of a correct schedule, you can try to enter
specific instructor preferences to ensure that each instructor gets exactly the
classes that are scheduled for that instructor in the Winter 2012 schedule.  It
would be better to enter preferences more broadly, such that Winter 2012
scheduled items are within the preference ranges, but preferences don't dictate
a particular schedule.
.hc p
.le
\fBGenerate the schedule\fP.  In addition to any reported problem, describe the
quality of the schedule that was automatically generated, in particular:
.(L a .2v
.le
Did it contain all classes?
.le
Were they at reasonable times?
.le
Were there any scheduling conflicts?
.)L a
.sp .6v
If the exact Winter 2012 was generated directly, say "Winter 2012 schedule
successfully generated, with no edits."  If there were one or more problems,
include links to the Jira issues that were posted for the problems.
.hc p
.le
\fBEdit the generated schedule\fP to get as close as possible to the published
Winter 2012 schedule.  Describe how close you were able to get to the actual
Winter 2012 schedule for the department, using the Scheduler program editing
functionality.  Again, our objective here is to use the Scheduler program to
create precisely the schedule that is published by the department for Winter
2012.
.sp .6v
After the preceding edits are done, perform some additional edits to test the
schedule editing functionality.  In particular, move courses around in the
schedule to test the incremental constraint and preference validation.
.hc p
.le
\fBSave the schedule\fP, exit the program, restart, and re-open the saved
schedule schedule.  Save a copy of the schedule on a different file, exit,
restart, and re-open both files.
.hc p
.le
\fBDescribe any quality measures\fP that
were not achieved during the preceding testing.  The quality measures are those
listed under the revised Week 5 features list in the project file:
.(Ah "http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/matrix.html"
\fCrequirements/matrix.html\fP.
.)Ah
.sp .6v
If all quality measures are
achieved satisfactorily, say "All quality measures met."  If not all quality
measures were covered during the preceding testing, then indicate this.  For
example, if you did not need to use course suffixing for your department, say
"Use of course suffixing not required for X department."
.le
\fBDescribe any other problems or issues\fP that were not covered in the
preceding testing steps, including overall UI look-and-feel and usability.
Include links to any new Jira issues that you post.
