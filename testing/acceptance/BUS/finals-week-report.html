Seems to work well. Not all classes went to 7AM anymore, which is nice.<br />
Edit dialog finally selects the correct instructors and locations

Bug with generate/drag off schedule:<br />
Generate a scheudle<br />
remove a schedule item via dragging<br />
generate again<br />
remove a different item from the schedule via dragging<br />
now both items are pulled off the schedule, when only the second item to be remove should be pulled off the schedule.<br />
Generate again and the program freezes<br />
<br />
Does not color the conflicts red

The features that should be working work surprisingly well considering how things went for most of the quarter. The program still needs a lot of work and some key features are still missing. (valid login, conflict highlighting, exporting, document merging, etc.)
