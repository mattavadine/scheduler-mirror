Entering Resource Data

<p>
I found the following problems:<br />

</p>

<br>
<h3>
Generating a Schedule
</h3>
<p>
a. The generated schedule did contain all the classes. <br />
b. The algorithm scheduled all of the classes during the 7-8am time slot on MWF due to the fact preferences are not working correctly.<br />
c. No scheduling conflicts were found.<br />
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Editing the Schedule
</h3>
<p>
The BUS schedule was not fully created successfully. See some of the bugs linked above. Also the following:<br />
https://scheduler.atlassian.net/browse/SCHED-108<br />
Also, one other issue that I cannot reproduce. I auto-generated all of the BUS classes. Then when I noticed that it put them all at 7 every day, I dragged them each off individually. Then I tried to place them back on the schedule and I kept getting a 500 error. Something about the database? I haven't been able to reproduce the problem, though, so I don't want to log an official issue on this just yet.
