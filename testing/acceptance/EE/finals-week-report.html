<h2>
1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
It saved correctly and I was able to re-open it.

<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data

</a>
<p>
Resource data entered in just fine. No (noticeable) data loss.

<h2>
3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Generated a schedule and it seemed to look just fine. One issue is that there may have been instructors scheduled to teach different courses at the same time.

<a name="Edit the Schedule">
<h2>
4.  Edit the Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Editing the schedule was pretty rough at best. It seemed to have trouble editing a course when there were a lot of other courses in the schedule. Maybe it was just too slow or something. Drag and drop didn't actually move the course as far as I saw. 
</p>

<a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">
<h2>
5.  Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Saved just fine, exited, and re-opened just fine. However, when I generated the schedule and tried to fiddle around with it a lot with editing, I got an error and it wouldn't let me log back in to the EE department under admin. It kept saying "Failed to retrieve documents" or something

6.  Quality Measures
</h2>
</a>
<p>
It's not anywhere close to deployable but at least it's improving. Possibly worth future work. Possibly....
