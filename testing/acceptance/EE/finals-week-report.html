1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule

It saved correctly and I was able to re-open it. Something went right? What?

2.  Enter Resource Data

<p>
When I was entering in resource data, I deleted a row in the middle of the Courses, and it screwed stuff up. It wouldn't let me edit any data under the row I deleted. When I saved and exited, then came back it was a little better. I could edit stuff again, but all of the classes were randomly shuffled for some reason.

Also, entering in the data was not easy. I couldn't just tab over to the next data entry. I had to double-click each box I wanted to edit. Something as simple as that makes it take a lot longer to add in the resources.

I didn't get this far, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it probably wouldn't have worked. Seems to be the theme.

The quality of this project is pretty awful overall right now.
