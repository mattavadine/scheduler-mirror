<p>
Existing Schedule "Derp" opened just fine.
<br><br>
Created a new schedule "Spring 2012" just fine, but the file menu only allowed me to save once. It would not open the file menu after the first time. When I logged back in to "Spring 2012," the data I was able to save was still there.

Locations - Locations saved just fine to the working copy, but I was not able to check and see if they saved to the database because the file menu stopped working.
<br><br>
Instructors - Instructors were entered just fine and they also retrieved course data successfully for preferences. Preference data saved to the working copy as well. <br>The "Schedulable" column with the checkboxes was a little screwy. No more than one instructor could be checked as "Schedulable" at a time, and as soon as you clicked anywhere else, the box became unchecked again. <br>Again was unable to try and save to the database.
<br><br>
Courses - Courses seemed to work the best of the three. Everything saved just fine to the working copy, and the "Schedulable" column for each row remained checked until unchecked (Meaning it seemed to be working correctly). The "Associations" column is still not working, or it just hasn't been explained well on how to use it. <br>Courses were able to be saved to the database correctly.

Generating a schedule was a complete failure yet again.

The things I could save the first time, it saved just fine, and those resources showed up when I re-opened the schedule.

Looks better than last quarter, and resources were easier to enter as well. Still doesn't do anything we need it to do though.

<p>
So the issue with the file menu seems to be pretty consistent. When I open up a schedule, it goes straight to the "Courses" resource tab. At that point, the file menu drops down just fine, and I can add resource data and save it while I'm in that tab. As soon as I leave the courses tab by clicking on any of the other tabs, the file menu no longer drops down. Even if I go back to the "Courses" tab, the file menu won't show up. At this point, only courses can be saved to the database, at least on my machine (OS: Windows 7; Browsers: Firefox and Chrome).
