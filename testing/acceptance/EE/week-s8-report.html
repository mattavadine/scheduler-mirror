<a name="Open an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule">
<h2>
1.  Open an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
There was no existing schedule to open.
<br><br>
Created a new schedule, added some resources. Saved it just fine.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Enter Resource Data">
<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
<p>
All resources that were added saved just fine and there were no errors when adding.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Generate a Schedule">
<h2>
3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Generating a schedule was a complete failure yet again. I had 4 classes, 4 instructors (with preferences set just fine), and 2 locations. When I hit generate, nothing popped up in the schedule area and the loading .gif stayed on the screen even if I went to a different tab. 
</p>

<a name="Edit the Schedule">
<h2>
4.  Edit the Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Was not able to get to this part
</p>

<br>
<a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">
<h2>
5.  Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
The resources saved just fine multiple times. I exited and re-opened and the resources were still there.
</p>

<a name="Quality Measures">
<h2>
6.  Quality Measures
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Does not pass the "Doesn't suck" test. The generate button is not reliable.
</p>

<a name="Other Issues">
<h2>
7.  Other Issues
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Our preferences window has some sizing issues we need to figure out.
