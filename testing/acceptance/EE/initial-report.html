Generating a Schedule
</h3>
<p>
<em>Generating a schedule is pretty bad so far. It took 
    a very long time to generate everything and Firefox kept prompting me with 
    a window talking about an unresponsive script. <br>

    <br>Did it contain all classes? Yes, all that I entered. But some were not able to be entered.<br><br>
    Were they at reasonable times? No. They were all in the morning because preferences had not been entered.<br>
    <br>Were there any scheduling conflicts? Yes. They were all at the same time.</em>
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Editing the Schedule
</h3>
<p>
<em>I was unable to edit the schedule at all. Trying to click and drag basically 
    froze my browser for a bit and did nothing. <br><br>
    The "Available Classes" and "Scheduled Classes" columns were not interacting correctly either.
    The The right column just remained blank.</em>
</p>

<br>
<h3>
Other Issues
</h3>
<p>
<em>When I hit "New Schedule" the menu bar at the top doubled in size, creating two tabs
    for Courses, Instructors, and Locations. I also could not remove anything from the
    schedule once it was scheduled.</em>
