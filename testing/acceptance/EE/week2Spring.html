<p>
Existing Schedule "Derp" opened just fine.
<br><br>
Created a new schedule "Spring 2012" just fine, but the file menu would not open up, so I could not save the data. When I logged back in, the "Spring 2012" schedule was still there, but it had no data in it.

Locations - Locations would not even save to the working copy. As soon as I left the tab and came back, location resources were no longer there.
<br><br>
Instructors - Instructors were entered just fine and they also retrieved course data successfully for preferences. Preference data saved to the working copy as well. <br>The "Schedulable" column with the checkboxes was a little screwy. No more than one instructor could be checked as "Schedulable" at a time, and as soon as you clicked anywhere else, the box became unchecked again. 
<br><br>
Courses - Courses seemed to work the best of the three. Everything saved just fine to the working copy, and the "Schedulable" column for each row remained checked until unchecked (Meaning it seemed to be working correctly). The "Associations" column is still not working. It just has question marks in the dropdown listbox. Also, it throws an exception sometimes, but I think that is only if there are no labs entered and saved yet.

3.  Generate a Schedule

<p>
I tried to generate a schedule with about 10 courses, 4 instructors, and 2 locations when I saw that I couldn't save the schedule (I didn't want to waste time adding stuff that wouldn't be saved). However, a dialog box popped up saying it "failed to retrieve somthing.something.something....." As far as I know, that either has to do with the fact that instructors don't remain checked as "Schedulable," and/or the Locations were not saved to the working copy. It might be some other problem as well though.

Wouldn't save; exited just fine; and re-opened with no resource data.

Looks better than last quarter, and resources were easier to enter as well. Still doesn't do anything we need it to do though.
