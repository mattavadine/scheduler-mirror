<strong>Report on Generating Winter 2012 Schedule for the CSC Department --
<br>
Testing of Week 6 Product Pre-Release</strong>

<a name="Open an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule">

1.  Open an Existing Schedule, Create a New Schedule

<p>
This appears to work for small-sized resource lists.  It needs to be more
thoroughly tested.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Enter Resource Data">
<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<strong>For all Three Resource Lists:</strong>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<strong><em>Question</em></strong> -- is this the layout for the Week 9 client
release, in particular the explicit 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons?  I'm mostly
fine with it as it is, and think it's better than previous versions with icons,
and other different layouts.
<p> <li>
Why is the extra 'New' button above the list?
<p> <li>
Time-of-entry appears to be the default sorting order for stable sorting of
secondary sort keys, which sometimes produces unusual-looking results.
<p> <li>
Sorting does not work consistently, in that it is sometimes unresponsive on
certain columns.  I cannot consistently reproduce the same problem, but it
shows up often enough to be considered repeatable.
</ol>
</p><p>
<strong>Instructors:</strong>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
How exactly is the 'Disabilities' column being used at this point?  In the
requirements, it's called 'Details', with an admittedly unclear definition
there.
<p> <li>
I believe there should be a 'Middle Name/Initial' column, in case some
department needs it.
</ol>
</p><p>
<strong>Courses:</strong>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
At present, there no explicit checkbox in the course edit table, meaning there
is not way to control what appears in the 'Available Courses' list in the
'Schedule' tab.
<p> <li>
The left-to-right order of the 'Courses' and 'Locations' tabs should be
swapped, since courses are by far more frequently edited than locations.
<p> <li>
The course type should be a drop-down, with all 5 types of course listed (LEC,
LAB, ACT, SEM, IND)
<p> <li>
Associations are only one-way, as lab-to-lecture.  We've discussed and I
thought we agreed that there is also the lecture-to-lab one-to-many
association.
<p> <li>
What has become of the 'Equipment Needed' column that is in Figure
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/resource-management.html#Manage%20Courses">
2.4.2.1
</a>
of the requirements?  It needs to be coordinated with the 'Equipment' attribute
of a location record (see below).
<p> <li>
The 'Department', 'Catalog Number', and 'Course Name' headings need to be
rethought, given the evolution of course resources from purely catalog entries
to a hybrid of catalog/schedule entries.  For background, see the headings at
<a href="http://schedules.calpoly.edu/subject_CSC.htm">
http://schedules.calpoly.edu/subject_CSC.htm
</a>
and
<a href="https://sched.csc.calpoly.edu/">
https://sched.csc.calpoly.edu/scheduleAction.php
</a>
</ol>
</p><p>
<strong>Locations:</strong>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
The left-to-right order of the 'Courses' and 'Locations' tabs should be
swapped, since courses are by far more frequently edited than locations.
<p> <li>
I believe the values in the 'Equipment' column need to be a user-editable list,
with pre-installed entries that can be removed, changed, and added to.  This
will coincide the now missing 'Equipment Needed' attribute for courses.
<p> <li>
Algorithmically, the there is a string/list match performed with equipment-
needed by course and the equipment-supplied by a location.
</ol>
</p>

<a name="Generate a Schedule">
<h2>
3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
This has some significant problems, the most critical aspects being the
following:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Everything is still piling up at 7AM.
<p> <li>
The four arrow keys don't appear to work.
<p> <li>
Drag-and-drop does not work consistently or understandably, in that not all
'Available Courses' can be dragged to 'Courses to Schedule'.
<p> <li>
During drag, I can get a course to drop onto the border of the 'Courses to
Schedule' list.  This results in subsequently unpredictable behavior, including
the course string appearing in the resource editing tabs.
<p> <li>
At one point, it hung indefinitely on 'Loading ...' during dragging from
'Available' to 'to Schedule' lists.
<p> <li>
None of the left/right arrow keys works.
</ol>
</p>

<br>
<a name="Edit the Schedule">
<h2>
4.  Edit the Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
The most significant problems are:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Drag-and-drop does not appear to be working as I'd expect.  In particular, when
I drag a course to a different time slot, it does not move, and I don't get any
message explaining why.
<p> <li>
An important feature for normal workflow is some way to clear out an entire
schedule, and regenerate it.  This could be as simple as a 'Clear Schedule'
button on the top button row of the
</ol>
</p><p>
Given the current state of drag-and-drop for generation and editing, I would
like to consider a crash implementation of a non-drag-and-drop solution that
uses the arrow keys for generation, and displays the schedule in a list view
that allows editing in the way it's done in the resource editing dialogs.  The
list view would be a version, possibly simplified, of
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/requirements/ViewRequirements.html#list_view">
Figure 2.3.1.1

in the requirements.

<a name="Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule">

5.  Save, Exit, Re-Open Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
'Save As' changes the name of a schedule when it should create a new copy.
</p>

<br>
<a name="Quality Measures">
<h2>
6.  Quality Measures
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<strong><em>Instructor Prefs:</em></strong> We cannot adequately assess this
until the databases are stable enough to allow a substantial number of
resources to be added, and rely on those resources not getting lost.
</p><p>
<strong><em>Resource Tables:</em></strong> Current lecture/lab association is
only one-way, i.e., labs-to-lectures.  Only LEC and LAB are supported; need
SEM, ACT, and IND.  The "invalid data" quality measure is still not being met,
in that it still warns with "You have unsaved data ..." when switching tabs.
</p>
<strong><em>Generate Schedule:</em></strong> Loading time is improved, but
still not always less than 5 seconds.  At least in the <tt>dev</tt> version of
Friday 12 Feb, there still seem to be significant problems with drag and drop.
On this date, there still was at least one "freezing issue", but hopefully the
new DB design will fix this problem area.
<br>
<a name="Other Issues">
<h2>
7.  Other Issues
</h2>
</a>
<p>
I have significant concerns that something usable by clients will be ready by
week 9.  At minimum, all of the issues listed above need to be fully resolved.
