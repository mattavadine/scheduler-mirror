\fBOn the Login Page:\fP
.(L a .3v
.le
With the top-most banner gone, which I like, we need a message identifying the
program, above or in place of the 'Login' label .  I suggest changing the
label 'Logon' to 'Login to the Scheduling Program'
.le
Need 10 to 20 pixels of padding between the text edit box and 'Login' button.
.le
Need some roll-over help on all of the widgets saying "If you need a login ID,
please contact your department scheduler."  We need to think about how this
relates to CAS authentication.  Specifically, once someone authenticates
through CAS, we then need to further filter to check that they are allowed
access to the scheduler program.  Again, this needs further thought.
.le
Need to have the 'Return' (aka, 'Enter') key be a keyboard shortcut for
pressing the 'Login' button.

\fBOn the 'My Scheduling Documents' page:\fP
.(L a .3v
.le
At present, there are two check box lines with empty document names.  This is
may be an artifact of recent fixes, or an 
.le
The relationship between the separate windows and the browser back button is
confusing. My interaction went like this:
.(L i
.le
Entered name schedule name "Winter 2012".
.le
Got new window with name "Winter%202012".
.le
Went back initial window and hit browser Refresh button, in hopes that the new
schedule document would show up in the list.
.le
Instead, pressing the browser Refresh took me to the Login page.
.le
I logged in again, and saw to copies of "Winter 2012" in the document list.
Not sure what just happened.
.le
So I delete both document and try to re-create with name "Winter 2012" and I
get "Error: Schedule named Winter 2012 already exists ...".  This is TOTALLY
ANNOYING.
.le
So I create "Winter 2012, Again"
.)L i
.le
The point of the preceding scenario was to try to get rid of the "%20"
characters in the schedule names, which I see at this point is just a bug that
needs to be fixed.
.le
There also appear to be extra characters in the name that stayed there 
when I pressed the 'Delete' button while entering the schedule name originally.
.le
Also, I think 'Trash' should be to the far right, not right next to 'Home'.
The point is that 'Trash' should have some visual separation from the
non-trash.
.le
If the 'My Scheduling Documents' window is going to stay up, it needs to
auto-refresh the list of schedule documents when new ones are created, not just
saved.  To distinguish in the list between saved and unsaved documents, there
can be some form of standard marker indicating that a document has unsaved
changes.
.le
With further interaction, I see that it refreshes when I press 'Home'; I'd
still like auto-refresh-on-create, and an 'unsaved changes' icon for each
document with unsaved changes.
.)L a
.hc p
... .le
\fBIn 'Trash' page:\fP
.(L a .3v
.le
There needs to be an 'Empty Trash' button at the bottom.
.le
I suspect that the reason that I can't reuse the name "Winter 2012" is that
it's in the trash; this should not be the case.  What's particularly confusing
in the current state is that there are two separate documents in the trash both
named "Winter 2012", and I cannot name a non-trash document "Winter 2012".
.le
I'm still not sure that this page is sufficiently intuitive or useful.  I might
prefer an iTunes style idea for trash, where when the user deletes a schedule
document, the program asked whether or not the document file should be deleted?
.le
This allows the normal file system to manage the trash.  It does of course
require that files actually be created for schedule documents, which I would
not mind at all.
.le
Need spacing between list and 'Restore ...' button at the bottom of the page.

\fBPressing Logout Button:\fP
.(L a .3v
.le
It's confusing to me to have two separate pages both logged out.
.le
In my opinion, this is one case of many where a web-based application is
inferior to a desktop application.
.)L a
.hc p
... .le
\fBPressing a schedule document link:\fP
.(L a .3v
.le
It's a bit confusing having the check box next to the name, in that it's not
initially clear if I need to check it to work on the document..le

I supposed this confusion will go away after some use.

\fBMiscellaneous:\fP

\fBGeneral:\fP
.(L a .2v
.le
As on other pages, there needs to be spacing around buttons.
.le
I think the top 'New' button should be removed, since the one at the bottom is
sufficient.
.le
The 'updateheadersidths' button needs to be removed.
.le
At present, I don't see any way to delete entries from any of the resource
pages.
.(L i
.le
We've discussed an number of alternatives to make this happen, the most
recent of which was allowing one or more rows selectable, with a 'Delete'
button on the bottom of the page.
.le
This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed before client deployment.
.)L i
.le
I find the 'Successfully Saved' pop-up increasingly annoying after a while,
particularly when it pops up after several seconds and I'm in the middle of
typing.
.le
Also, I inadvertently typed 'Command-S' to save and got the Browser's save
dialog; I think this may confuse some users.
.hc p
.le
In Firefox:
.(L i
.le
When single clicking, edit typing bar does not appear consistently in edit
boxes.  Need to double click to get typing bar in the correct place.
.le
When typing tab, edit typing bar goes one past where it should be.

Copy and paste of rows would be very handy.

MAJOR ERROR 1:
.(L i
.le
After entering six rows, but before saving, I selected the small vertical line
with 3 vertical dots on the left of a row and then hit the 'Delete' key; the
intent was to try to delete an empty row.
.le
The program logged me out and put me back at the 'Login' page.
.le
All unsaved data were lost.
.)L i
MAJOR ERROR 2:
.(L a
.le
While entering about the tenth course, I pressed the delete key in the normal
way within a data entry box and I got this error:
.(t
There was an error getting the schedules: 500 The call failed on the server;
see server log for details.
.)t
.le
The entire document appears to be lost.
.)L a
.le
Evidently there is no uniqueness criterion for courses.
.(L i
.le
I entered separate rows, with the same values for all data fields and it saved
OK.
.le
This should not be possible.
.le
That is, I suggest that the uniqueness criterion should be that no to courses
can have exactly the same values for all data fields.
.)L i
.le
\&'Department' heading should be 'Prefix'.
.le
\&'Catalog Number' heading should be 'Number'.
.le
In Firefox, the drop-down in the 'Course Type' is difficult to work with, in
particular 'click-release' does not work to select the down arrow, but instead
requires 'click-and-hold'.
.le
In Firefox, I could not get the drop-down under 'Associations' to select
anything other that '(none)'.  [UPDATE: it worked after more than one course
was entered; I think the initial error is reproducible.]
.le
\f[BI]WTU and SCU Conceptual Issues:\fP
.(L i
.le
I believe the WTU value should have a defaults entered as follows: 4 for a
3-hour lecture, 5 for a 4-hour lecture, 1 for a 3-hour lab.
.le
There needs to be some way to account for variable WTU values; it may be that
we just enter multiple rows of the same course, but I'd prefer to be able to
input a WTU range in one row, as in "1-4".
.le
I don't think we need the SCU column for scheduling purposes; I suggest we
remove it.

MAJOR ERROR:
.(L i
While entering the third name, I pressed 'Delete' and I moved from the "Winter
2012, V3" schedule to another schedule.
.le
Without a way to go back to the dismissed Home page, I had to log in again and
select "Winter 2013, V3" again.  [Subsequent update -- I now see
that 'File->New' 
.le
All entered instructor data were lost!

I'm reticent to waste further time entering real data until the system is more
usable and reliable; I'll proceed anyway.

I think we need a clear way to include a middle initial
