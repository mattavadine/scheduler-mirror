<strong>Spring Week 2 Acceptance Test Report for the CSC Department</strong>

Browser Used for Testing: Safari

<a name="Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule">
<h2>
1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<strong>On the Login Page:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
We still have a MAJOR PROBLEM with database bleeding.  The CSC  page started
out with a default schedule named 'Derp', which is apparently from the GRC
department.
<p> <li>
Initial loading took about 20 seconds.  This my have to do with mounted disk
access, but we should look into this.
<p> <li>
MAJOR PROBLEM: I had to logout and log back in to see a newly created schedule.
<p> <li>
The 'Schedule already exists ...' pop-up message took around a minute to
appear; it should happen instantly when the user tries to name a new schedule
with an existing name.
<p> <li>
Change the label "Schedulizerifier" to "Class Scheduler" on all pages.  Also,
the topmost label needs to be made more distinctive in terms of placing (I
suggest centered), color (I suggest some shade of Cal Poly dark green) font (I
suggest less formal looking something like Calbri, with a lighter shade of
green shadow).
<p> <li>
Most buttons still need some padding.  Also, they should be laid out
horizontally, not vertically.
</ol>

<a name="Enter Resource Data">
<h2>
2.  Enter Resource Data
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<strong>Courses:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Spacing in column names needs to be adjust so that short names are in narrower
columns and longer names show the full label text by default.  This means we
should likely update the column names to be shorter abbreviations and/or put
column names in two centered lines instead of one
<p> <li>
For me, the first column title 'Schedulable' is not clear.  I suggest
'In\nSchedule'.
<p> <li>
I recall a decision to put number as the left-most entry in each row, a la
Excel and Google Docs spreadsheets.  I like this decision.
<p> <li>
'Type' drop-down took about 5 seconds to appear the first time.  MAJOR PROBLEM:
In the midst of entering course data, I got the pop-up message 'Failed to
retrieve courses!'.
<ul>
<li>
Under normal operating conditions, this message should never appear.
<li>
I had to log out and log back in again to re-connect to the database.  All
entered courses appear to have been lost.
<li>
I cleared out all browser caches and history, exited the browser and started
again, with all entered data still showing as having been lost.  While adding
the first new row, I got the 'Failed to retrieve courses!' error dialog again
when clicking on the 'Associations' drop-down.
<li>
Subsequently, 'Associations' drop-down list said 'No Items To Show'.
</ul>
<p> <li>
MAJOR PROBLEM: I proceeded to add a new row, and in the middle of typing, some
old data showed up, along with.
<p> <li>
Since I was having trouble in Safari, I tried to connect with Firefox, without
closing the Safari session.
<ul>
<li>
I had trouble in one Firefox window, but was able to connect in another Firefox
window.
<li>
MAJOR PROBLEM: I then went back to the Safari window and the 'Associations'
drop-down appeared one time only, and then failed to appear with additional
clicks on the any enter in the 'Associations' column; the 'No Items To Show'
message appeared.
</ul>
<p> <li>
As in Login page, buttons need some padding and should be laid out
horizontally, not vertically.
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Instructors:</strong>
<ol type=a>
<li>
Made one entry and pressed its 'Preferences' button.
<li>
The preference dialog appeared with the message 'The database doesn't contain
any course right now ...', even though there had been two visible entries in
the Courses resource table before going to 'Instructors'.
<li>
Went back to look at 'Courses' table, and the 'No items to show.' message
appeared in the place where data rows had been previously.
</ol>

6.  Quality Measures

<p>
Given inability to reliably enter resource data, doing a detailed evaluation of
quality measures is inappropriate at this time.

My overall rating of the program at this totally unacceptable.
