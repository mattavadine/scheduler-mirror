1.  Create, Save, and Re-Open a New Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>works very well</li>
    <li>sometimes i accidently log out instead of closing a document (right top) - maybe an "X" close button would be useful (happens since the document doesn't open in a new tab but in the same window)</li>
</ul>

3.  Generate a Schedule
</h2>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Works as long as if enough instructors are entered. If not the courses will be all scheduled to 7am.</li>
    <li>Regenerating a schedule that already existed blows up sometimes.</li>
    <li>It is not possible to delete a generated Schedule quickly. You have to drag all of the courses manually back to the list.</li>
    <li>The lines between the days seem to disappear when courses are scheduled</li>
</ul>

6.  Quality Measures

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Editing a generated schedule is not very convenient because it is very work intensive to remove already scheduled courses</li>
