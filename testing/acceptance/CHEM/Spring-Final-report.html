	Completed successfully.  <br>
	It is a bit unintuitive to have day combinations start as all enabled.<br>
	When the resources got to the bottom the page and required a scrollbar, scrolling down to press the "Add new" button bar would
	result in the page scrolling back up automatically after second.  This made it a pain to hit the "Add new" resource button since the page would scroll
	up (and thus hiding the bar) while I was attempting to click it.

Schedule generation worked and appeared to take into account preferences.

Usability wise,
Manually adding items to the Calendar worked.<br>

Successful except with one instance where I tried using associations.

<p>
When there was a large number of documents with a large number of items in each, information too noticably longer to load.<br>
When adding in a large number of courses with association, Schedule would display an infinite loading gif when trying to reopen it.<br>
It is getting more usable, however it lacks the polish needed to make it enjoyable to use.

Overall, I would not use this program.  It needs more work to make it stable and usable enough for consistent use.
