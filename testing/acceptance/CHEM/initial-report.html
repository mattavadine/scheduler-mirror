<h3>
Generating a Schedule
</h3>
<p>
<p> <li>
Did it contain all classes?<br>
All classes that were entered.  However, since many were not able to be input, it technically was missing a large number of classes.
<p> <li>
Were they at reasonable times?<br>
No. The classes were all at 7am.
<p> <li>
Were there any scheduling conflicts? <br>
No. However, since instructor prefs were not working, there could be no conflicts.

<h3>
Editing the Schedule
</h3>
<p>
I was unable to complete a schedule due to the browser crashing/hanging when generating a large schedule or attempting to edit a large schedule.<br>
