Selection of rows in resources tables is still awkward/unintuivie (Already an issue filed for this) <br>

<p>
When deleting course resources, the first course was unable to be deleted.<br>
When the schedule was "Saved As..." as new one, when the schedule tab was gone to the schedule could not be retrieved.  At some future point, any attempts to log into CHEM are with a 500 error Failed to log in "The call failed on the server". <br>
When I can figure out how/if these are recreatable on the Deptx version, I will create jira issues for them.</p>
