Add an introductory paragraph, that provides an overview of what automatic
scheduler generation entails.  Include a note that the Chem department will be
used throughout the requirements scenarios.

2.2.1P1	GLF	11nov11	FIX	T{
Refer explicitly to Figure 2.2.1.1.  Explain what it means for a course not to
have an explicit LEC or LAB designation.  Consider having roll-over course
details and/or the ability to augmented-click to get details for a particular
course.

2.2.1I2.2.1.1	GLF	11nov11	FIX	T{
Make consistent with prototype.  In particular, the prototype should not have a
parenthesized number after the courses in the 'Dept Courses' column.  Add
vertical lines in body of table delineating each day column.  Note that there
is an option for adding weekend days, and site future scenario section that
explains that option.  I prefer the prototype column label of 'Courses to
Schedule' instead of 'Auto Fill'.  I prefer the prototype button name 'Generate
Schedule' to 'Auto Fill'.

Add a brief introductory paragraph.  This would be a good place to describe the
uniform coloring designation used throughout the scenarios, i.e.,
