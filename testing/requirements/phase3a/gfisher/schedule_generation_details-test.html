<strong><em>Currently non-existent.</em></strong> One or more requirements team
member needs to write this, to address the following points:
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
Define precisely the terms "preference" and "constraint".
<p> <li>
Describe and do use cases for the preferences that clients have requested, or
which have appeared consistently in past 308 scheduling requirements,
including:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Course overlap.
<p> <li>
Time and distance proximity.
<p> <li>
Room equipment requirements.
</ol>
<p> <li>
Describe all possible sources of preference and constraint violation, and state
which level each is (green, yellow, orange, red).  Define metrics for schedule
fairness and quality, and do a couple use cases for each.
<p> <li>
Do a scenario that shows the following form of schedule editing:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
scheduling admin "tweaks" per-term database entries to broaden instructor
prefs, re-prioritize some prefs, etc.
<p> <li>
the admin locks in certain scheduled entries that he wants to keep as is
<p> <li>
the admin re-generates the schedule and sees if he gets a better result
</ol>
</ol>
