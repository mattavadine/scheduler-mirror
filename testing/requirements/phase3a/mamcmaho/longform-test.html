    <td valign=top>Include in the description what the +2's indicate in the Auto-Generate Courses list.

    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>It's hard tell what the green schedule cells with no text in them are; would be more clear if they didn't have borders.

    <td valign=top>2.2.2P1
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/16/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>The user can only drag a course onto one day column at a time, how do they specify which days the course should appear on? i.e. if the user drags a course on to the Monday column, how does the program know if they want to schedule the course for MWF, MTWR, MF ...etc?

    <td valign=top>11/16/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Showing a radio box with an option for each possible permutation of days might not scale well when many permutations are possible.  Consider a course that is dragged onto Monday, possible permutations are M, MT, MW, MR, MF, MTW, MTR, MTF, MWR, MWF, MRF, MTWR, MTWF, MTRF, MWRF, MTWRF.

    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Image shows that the course is being scheduled from 7AM-9PM, looks like it should be 9AM.

    <td valign=top>Typo "In Figure 2.2.2.3 the user attempt to..." change to attempts or attempted.

    <td valign=top>2.2.2
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/16/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>In all the images which show a brightly colored schedule item, it's hard to tell that these items are in the middle of a drag; Add a mouse pointer over the schedule items to indicate that they are being dragged.
