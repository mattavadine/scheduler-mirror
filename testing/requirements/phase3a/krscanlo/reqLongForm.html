    <td valign=top>2.4.1 Manage Instructors
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Within the screenshot, the column contents should be left justified. Also, the name "Instructor Overview" doens't seem appropriate. Make sure that the screenshot is consistent with the current implementation in the prototype which is more user friendly. 
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2.4.2 Manage Courses
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Include a basic overview of what each of the columns is along with what the contents of the column can contain. For the delete course, the dialog should appear over the table.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2.4.3 Manage Locations
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
		For location type, use a combo box instead of check boxes.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2.5.1 Course Preferences
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Show all of the options in the dropdown in figure 2.5.1.1. Look into changing the definitions of Preferred, Acceptable, Not Preferred, Not Possible, to something more realistic. So instead of Not Preferred being "It would put strain on me, but I could teach this course if necessary, instead, put "It would require preparation, but I could teach this course if necessary"
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2.5.2 Time Preferences
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
		This page needs to be reworked, the table is not intuative, and should be rethought.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		2.5.3 Distance Preference
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Make the Save and Cancel buttons closer together in Figure 2.5.3.1
