<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Slide Title</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Status</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Remarks</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Log In
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>"Commands along the left" is now along the "top." 
The "HOME" screen doesn't seem to exist visually. There isn't any requirement about logging in using you're Cal Poly credentials. Also, the "screenshot" is entirely too large making it not meet the production quality standards. It barely fits across my external 27" monitor.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Home Screen -Select a Term
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>The user isn't "selecting" a quarter and year that they are scheduling for, they are "determining" as it is a task that has something to do with their own thought process, not something that they are "selecting" using the program. There also aren't any details about "naming" a schedule. Once again, the "screenshot" is too large.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Create a New Schedule
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain that "all possible department courses" are determined by the courses entered into the database. Make the nomenclature consistent between the description and the screen shot "Autofill" or "Auto-generate" or "Autofill" vs "Auto Fill." Also, out of curiosity, should the time column have times that match the "Cal Poly Time" using the 10 mins. after the hour notation.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Generation Autofill
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Make the nomenclature consistent "Autofill" or "Auto Fill." 
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Generation Hover
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Consider fixing the html "empty box" issue, it is distracting and takes away from the "production quality" of the requirements.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Generation Drag Accepted
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain the light vs. neon colored green usage in the screenshot
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Manually Schedule Multi-Pattern Course
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>In the description, please explain after what "user action" does the window pop up
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Generation Valid Drag (Multiple Days)
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain the user action, because the action isn't clear based on the title
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Manually Override Preference
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain the user action, because the action isn't clear based on the title
 <tr>
    <td valign=top>Manual Action Denied
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>The light orange color was not explained. Also, pick a better shade of this color, because the current color is not aesthetically pleasing. Choose a lighter shade of red.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Management
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain how the user navigates to this page.
<tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule List View
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain how the "warnings" are given
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>List View Filter
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>By default, "All" should be selected, and that should check all of the other boxes.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Schedule Calendar View
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Instead of calling it a "scrolling box" it should be called a "drop down box" scrolling implies that there is some sort of movement.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Calendar View Dropdown
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Make sure the nomenclature across this slide and the previous slide is consistent.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Calendar View Filter
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>By default, "All" should be selected, and that should check all of the other boxes in the filter.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Course Summary View
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Explain the arrow drop down next to the class name
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Manage Instructors
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Left justify the contents of the columns. Fix the description, the "manage section" no longer exists.
	Also, fix the Edit and Delete functionality to match that of the prototype
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Edit an Instructor
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Fix the edit and delete functionality to match that of the prototype. 
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Add an Instructor
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Fix the Add functionality to match that of the prototype.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Remove an Instructor
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>Make this more like a popup over the Instructor table, instead of a separate page
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Manage Courses
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Left justify the contents of the column. See above notes about Instructor, and apply the same changes to Courses.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		Manage Locations
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;
		Left justify the contents of the column. See above notes about Instructor, and apply the same changes to Locations.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		Instructor Course Preferences	
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		In the description, it references a button on the "previous slide" that does not exist. Also, show all the options for an instructor preference.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		Instructor Time Preferences
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		This view is clunky in general, we should discuss alternatives to the way the table is laid out. Also, is this a dialog or is it a separate page in the navigation.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
		Instructor Distance Preferences
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Move the save and cancel button closer together in the center.

<strong><em>Overall Presentation Inspection:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Slide Title</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Status</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Remarks</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Story Line</em>
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		While the general story line makes sense, we should consider putting the database table first
		because that is the logical starting place. Also, a lot of "user actions" are omitted which would be
		helpful in explaining how a user got to a particular page, or what they clicked on to receive a particular action (see the above notes for details).
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Look</em>
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		While the "screenshot" sizing is consistent, it is rather large, for production quality we should consider making smaller screenshots. Also, make sure that some of the changes that were made in the prototype are updated in the requirements (see above for details).	
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><em>Consistent Content</em>
    <td valign=top>
		FIX
    <td valign=top>
		Make sure that the content is consistent with the prototype in the places that the prototype is more advanced than the requirements.
