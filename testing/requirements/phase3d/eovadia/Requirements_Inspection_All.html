<table border="1">
<tr><th>Component</th><th>Status</th><th>Remarks</th></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.1</td><td>FIX</td><td>There should be a file menu, and no schedule chooser menu</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.2</td><td>FIX</td><td>As per simple scheme, there should be no 13 Instructors / 32 Courses / 7 Locations under the New Schedule button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.2</td><td>IDEA</td><td>In the list on the home page, next to each schedule's name, we should have in parentheses, number instructors, number courses, number locations, status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.2</td><td>FIX</td><td>As per simple scheme, there should be no 13 Instructors / 32 Courses / 7 Locations under the New Schedule button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2.1</td><td>FIX</td><td>As per simple scheme, there should be no second list</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2.1</td><td>FIX</td><td>Since we have autosaving, there should be no Save Schedule button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.2</td><td>IDEA</td><td>There can be different ways to color the schedule, according to a dropdown. The main coloring scheme is by instructor time preferences; any course that conflicts with the instructor's time preferences should be colored red. A secondary coloring scheme is by conflicts with other courses; any conflicting courses will be colored red. A third coloring scheme is by instructor distance prefs, a fourth is by instructor course prefs, and a fifth could be all of those views together (anything which would have been red in any of the first four views will show up as red in the fifth)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.1.2</td><td>IDEA</td><td>There should be a warning above a schedule if not all courses are in the generated schedule. There should also be warnings telling us how many conflicts with instructor preferences, other courses, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3</td><td>FIX</td><td>Explain why the filter box is different from the search menu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3</td><td>IDEA</td><td>Have a way to hide the list to the left of the generated schedule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.1</td><td>FIX</td><td>Take out the generate and save buttons for the weekly view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.2</td><td>FIX</td><td>Explain what the arrows next to the course names do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.3</td><td>FIX</td><td>Schedule Weekly View's image's title (Schedule View) is inconsistent with Schedule Weekly View</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.3</td><td>FIX</td><td>Change the name of this view to Compact Weekly View.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.3</td><td>IDEA</td><td>When we hover over an item in the weekly dropdown, we should highlight any cells that contain the same section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.3.3</td><td>FIX</td><td>Clarify that the dropdown doesnt do anything but view. Selecting an item in it doesnt do anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.5.2</td><td>FIX</td><td>Use a different yellow, that shit is disgusting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.5.3</td><td>IDEA</td><td>We should link to maps.calpoly.edu from the instructor distance preferences so they know where all the buildings are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.6.1</td><td>IDEA</td><td>Instead of a special commit/update button to peoplesoft, we should have peoplesoft be one of the import/export options! brilliance!</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>IDEA</td><td>Shouldnt we have preferences like "no 400 and 500 classes overlap"?</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>IDEA</td><td>Put in a 5th view, the Massive View, which has all day/time combinations down the left, and all the locations on the top. maybe even an option for instead of rooms on the top, instructors instead. This will be a huge table, so shrink it down. it will be unreadable. have the mouse be a 200px x 200px magnifying glass, so anything it's over is zoomed. Could be a terrible or great idea, needs investigation.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>FIX</td><td>Courses might need a "max enroll" and "enroll limit" field, for the weird padding-of-5-seats thing that teachers do.</td></tr>
