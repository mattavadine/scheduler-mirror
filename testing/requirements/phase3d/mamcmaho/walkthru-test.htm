Somehow I got out of sync with the testing schedule and have completed testing on all slides at phase 3c. 
<ul>
<li>Tests for slides Log In to Manual Action Denied can be found in my phase 3a directory.</li>
<li>Tests for slides List View to Manage Locations can be found in my 3b directory.</li> 
<li>Tests for slides Instructor Course Preferences to Instructor Distance Preferences can be found in my 3c directory.</li>
</ul>
