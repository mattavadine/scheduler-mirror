    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>These explainations should come after each of the views have been presented. It's easier to understand their context once I've seen the whole view. 
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.0 P4
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Not sure how these column filters work. It would help to show an illustrated example of what they do.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.1 P2
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Capitalize sentences. In explaination of Department, get rid of "displays", change "is a part of" to "is offered by". In explaination of Section Number, change "specific number" to "unique number". Research SCU.  
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.2 P1
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>"It shows all the information displayed by PASS" is not a specific requirement and its meaning will change if PASS changes.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.2 I1
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>It's not clear that SEC, TYPE, CLS#, etc are column headings. Would be better if they appeared over the columns of data, under the course headings. Not sure what the purpose is of the black line between sections 04 and 11 of CHEM 110. "Genl Chem : Engr Disciplines I" should not have abbreviations if it is the full course name.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.2 P2
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>In description of Type, remove "or not".
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.3.3 P1
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011
    <td valign=top>Fix
    <td valign=top>Change "look of all the courses" to "table" or "schedule". Change "searching out" to "searching for", or may be replace with a description of what is meant by "searching out". Pluralize "Instructor". Capitalize "rooms" to go along with capitalizing other terms such as Instructor and Courses (I don't think any of these terms should be capitalized, but this sort of Capitalizing of words happens all over Other Sections of the requirements and Walk Through, so for the Sake of uniformity, Capitalize the Word "rooms").

    <td valign=top>2.4.1 P1
    <td valign=top>MM 
    <td valign=top>11/23/2011

    <td valign=top>Remove "(s)" from "text field(s)".
