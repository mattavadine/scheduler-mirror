Need to expand discussion in introductory paragraphs.  Include discussion of
the following topics:
.(E .2v
.hc p
.ee
The fact that no department data are pre-loaded into the scheduling program,
and therefore an initial data-entry task will be required.  Refer to Section
2.4 for details.
.hc p
.ee
The way that a "template" schedule can be defined, so that entered data can be
re-used from quarter to quarter.  This description needs to be consistent with
the way stored data are referred to throughout the scenarios.  For example,
we need a precise definition of "saved for the department" in the following
sentence that appears at the beginning of Section 2.4:
.(i
"The Instructor Overview list displays a list of all instructors saved for the
department".
.)i
All of the scenarios need to use language that is consistent with the
stored data functionality described here in Section 2.1.
.hc p
.ee
The details of administrator versus instructor interfaces.  I am assuming that
we still plan to provide an interface for individual instructors to set
preferences, since that functionality important to a number of interviewed
clients.  That interface would be an instructor-specific version of the
administrative version in Section 2.5.
