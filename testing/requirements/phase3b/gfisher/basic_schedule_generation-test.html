Add an introductory paragraph, that provides an overview of what automatic
schedule generation entails.  Include a note that the Chem department is used
throughout the requirements scenarios.  Explain that the Chem department
provides a reasonably representative example of departments across campus.
<p>
Add a second introductory paragraph that describes the uniform coloring
designation used throughout the scenarios, i.e.,
<a href="http://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha//requirements/images/preference-colors-sketch.jpg"></a>
Note that we have not fully determined which colors are appropriate for use in
schedule generation.  At present, green, orange, and red are used.  We need to
determine if yellow has any meaning in the context of schedule generation, and
if so, add a use case that illustrates it.  The thinking as of Friday 18 Nov
was the following:
<ul>
<li>
Green = preferred by both department and instructor
<li>
Yellow = preferred by department, not-preferred by instructor
<li>
Orange = not preferred by department, as well as not-preferred by instructor
<li>
Red = not possible, i.e., a hard scheduling conflict
</ul>

Refer explicitly to Figure 2.2.1.1.  Explain what it means for a course not to
have an explicit LEC or LAB designation.  Consider having roll-over course
details and/or the ability to perform an augmented-click to get details for a
particular course.

Make consistent picture with prototype.  In particular, the prototype should
not have a parenthesized number after the courses in the 'Dept Courses' column.
I prefer the prototype column
label of 'Courses to Schedule' instead of 'Auto Fill'.  I prefer the prototype
button name 'Generate Schedule' to 'Auto Fill'.
<p>
Add vertical lines in body of table, delineating each day column.  Add a note
that there is an scheduling too option for adding weekend days, and site later
scenario section that explains that option.

See immediately preceding comments about column label and button name.
<p>
Also, add the detailed explanation of drag-drop that Tyler V gave during the
Friday meeting.  That is, as course are dragged from the 'Department Courses'
column into the 'Courses to Schedule' column, one section is dragged at a time.
When more than one section is dragged, then there is '+<em>n</em>' next to the
course in the 'Courses to Schedule' column, where <em>n</em> is the number of
sections that have been dragged.  There needs to be an option-settable upper
bound on the number of sections that can be dragged, to avoid the admittedly
unusual problem of section overflow.
<p>
Also explain how a section is moved to the calendar schedule instead of
the 'Courses to Schedule' column, in particular that the total number of
sections to schedule is the of the <em>n</em> in the 'Courses to Schedule' column
and the number of courses dragged into the calendar view.
<p>
Also explain how a section is removed from the 'Courses to Schedule' column or
the calendar view.  This is presumably done by dragging the course back to
the 'Department Courses' column, or even to some other place on the screen
other than the 'Courses to Schedule' column or schedule.

As discussed on Friday, these updates to the content of 2.2.1P2

I would really like a feature to allow the user to explicitly (manually) specify
the number of sections for each course to schedule.

The last sentence refers to the 'Save Schedule' button.  See the discussion of
this in the
<a href="">
userInterface inspection, and make the reference to saving
consistent with the decision on how saving is done.

If it is determined that a yellow color is meaningful in the context of
schedule generation, then add a use case, i.e., a figure and explanatory
paragraph.
