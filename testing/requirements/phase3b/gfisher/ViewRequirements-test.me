Change "various metrics" to "various criteria".

This section lacks a description of the user actions needed to bring up the
different displays.  In particular, how do we get from the end of Section 2.2,
to the beginning of section 2.3.  Is it pressing the 'Generate' button?
However it is, I'd like to have this explained at the top of 2.3, and have
Figure 2.3.1.1 be the first figure of the section, with a clear explanation of
how the user gets from Figure 2.2.1.2 to Figure 2.3.1.1.

Change the 'Viewing Options' label to a sentence of the form "Figure 2.3.1
shows the viewing options component of the schedule view UI."

As above, the paragraph text does not need to repeat the names of each column
label, just refer to them collectively, followed by the bulleted list of
descriptions.  I.e., you can have a sentence of the following form immediately
above the bulleted list: "The the columns containt the following
information:".  Also important is to have the names of the collumn in the
bulleted list match exactly the names in the UI, e.g., "Dept" instead of
"Department"; "Course #" instead of "Course Number".

2.3.3.I2.3.3.1	GLF	21nov11	FIX	T{
Show the 'Weekly' radio button selected.  Also, what is the relationship
between this view and the similar calendar view in Section 2.2?  What does the
user do to get one or the other of these views?  I'd like them both available,
but I'm not clear how that happens with only one 'Weekly' ratio button.  Also,
what is the relationship between the actual schedule shown in Section 2.2
versus 2.3?  They're similar, but not the same.  These issues need to be
clarified.
