2.4.1P7 (Add Instructor)	GLF	21nov11	FIX	T{
After you say that the user can "navigate away" in order not to save the
information, you need to then say that when the user comes back, the unsaved
information is still in the UI.  This is the idea of the persistent user
workspace we've talked about in class discussion, where the user can type
information without saving it, navigate away, and then come back with the
unsaved type information still there.
