Need to expand discussion in introductory paragraphs.  Include discussion of
the following topics:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The fact that no department data are pre-loaded into the scheduling program,
and therefore an initial data-entry task will be required.  Refer to Section
2.4 for details.
<p>
<li>
The way that a "template" schedule can be defined, so that entered data can be
re-used from quarter to quarter.  This description needs to be consistent with
the way stored data are referred to throughout the scenarios.  For example,
we need a precise definition of "saved for the department" in the following
sentence that appears at the beginning of Section 2.4:
<blockquote>
"The Instructor Overview list displays a list of all instructors saved for the
department".
</blockquote>
All of the scenarios need to use language that is consistent with the
stored data functionality described here in Section 2.1.
<p>
<li>
The details of administrator versus instructor interfaces.  I am assuming that
we still plan to provide an interface for individual instructors to set
preferences, since that functionality important to a number of interviewed
clients.  That interface would be an instructor-specific version of the
administrative version in Section 2.5.
</ul>

For the final version of the requirements, I would like to eliminate the
top-most green banner, and have the UI look like the proposed operational
program.
