<strong><em>Currently empty.</em></strong> One or more requirements team member
needs to write this, to address the following points:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
positive impacts if the product is installed and used
<p> <li>
negative impacts if the product is installed and used, including but not
limited to the following areas:
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
distribution problems
<p> <li>
installation problems
<p> <li>
regular usage problems
<p> <li>
issues raised by Erik Wilkenson's analysis that relate specifically to positive
and negative product impacts
</ol>
Regarding the last item, if Erik has a specific section devoted to this in his
marketing study (new Section 1.6), then you can site that section here, rather
than reiterating it.  Talk to Erik about this, ekwilkin@calpoly.edu.
