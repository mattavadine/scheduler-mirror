<h3><a name="Problem Statement">1.1. Problem Statement </a></h3>
 

<p>The general problems to be addressed by the Scheduler Tool project are the
following: </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>to provide a reliable and easy to use software tool that manages the Cal
    Poly CSC Scheduling System </li>
  <li>to provide a secure tool that can provide staff and students with a fair
    and optimal schedule. </li>
</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and
public domain products, the Scheduler Tool provides a solution with certain
functional improvements over existing tools. Specific problem areas are the
following: 
<ol type="a">
  <li>Student input as feedback.</li>
  <li>Instructor prefrences as schedule criteria </li>
  <li>providing a wide range of schedule viewing options </li>
</ol>

<p>The Scheduler Tool project addresses the requirements of a particular
customer. This customer needs a tool with a collection of features not
available in any single existing tool. This aspect of the problem is one of
combining a set of existing features in a way that the features have yet to be
combined in another product. </p>

<p>In addition, the development of functioning software, the Calendar Tool
project focuses on two additional problems not addressed in commercial tools:
</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>to provide a pedagogical example for use in the instruction of software
    engineering, including an example of the practical application of formal
    methods </li>
  <li>to provide fully documented, public domain source code for use by others
  </li>
</ol>
