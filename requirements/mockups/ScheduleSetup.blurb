The Schedule Setup screen allows the user to specify which courses will be included when the schedule is generated.  If a previous schedule has already been made, the offered courses list will be populated with the previous schedule's list of offered courses.  If no previous schedule exists, all the courses will appear on the master course list.  From there the user can drag the desired courses to the offered courses list or drag them to specific times on the calendar to enforce time constraints.  Once a course is moved to the offered course list or the calendar it is removed from the master course list.
