<strong>Scenario Sketch for 28 November Discussion</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
This scenario assumes that the user has opened and generated schedules for
three upcoming quarters, with Fall 2012 as the current working schedule.
Figure 1 shows the result of these user actions.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<a name="Figure Fall 2012 as the current working schedule.">

<br>

</p><p>
The 'File' menu contains commands related to creating and opening schedules.
To the right of the 'File' menu are tabs for each open schedule.  In the
Figure, 'Fall 2012' is the current working schedule.  The user selects another
tab to select that schedule as the current working schedule.  <em>The content
of the 'Fall 2012' tab is a screen shot of the current schedule viewing
requirements.</em>
</p><p>
When the user selects the 'File' menu, the program displays it as shown in
Figure 2.

<em>This is the same menu as Kaylene drew last week, with the addition of a
'Close' item.</em>
</p><p>
When the user selects the 'Generate' tab in the main menu, the program displays
the editing window shown in Figure 3.

<br>
<br>

<br>

Each of the currently open schedules is in a separate tab.  The user may switch
between these schedules to perform schedule generation and manual editing
operations.  <em>The content of the 'Fall 2012' tab is a screen shot of the
current schedule generation requirements.</em>
</p><p>
When the user selects the 'Instructors' tab in the main window, the program
displays the editing window shown in Figure 4.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<a name="Figure The instructors window, with operational context being the Fall 2012 schedule.">

<br>

The instructors scheduled for each of the currently open schedules is in a
separate tab.  The rightmost tab has the instructors for the entire department.
The user may switch between these schedules to perform schedule editing
operations.  <em>The content of the 'Fall 2012' tab is a screen shot of the
current instructor editing requirements.</em>
</p><p>
<strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The per-quarter tabbing scheme is effectively
my answer to the "Master List" question.  The sub-tabs in the inner window
consistently contain all open schedules.
<ul>
<li>
In the main 'Schedules' tab, there is a 'File' menu on the far left.
<p>
<li>
In the main 'Generate' tab, there is no menu, but each of the open schedules
has its own tab.
<p>
<li>
In the main 'Instructors', 'Courses', and 'Locations' tabs, there are
(consistently) tabs for the currently open schedules, the content of which are
the "per-quarter" data for that schedule.  The far-right tab has the full-
department data for instructors, courses, and rooms.  With the tabs providing
context, it is clear to the user which version of the data the user is editing.
</ul>
