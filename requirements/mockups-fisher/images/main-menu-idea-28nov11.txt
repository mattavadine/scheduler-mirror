'Schedules' is a drop-down, as the the down-pointing arrow indicates.  This
idea is consistent with Google's top-level interface, as well as other Google
pages.  The idea is that the drop-down arrow distinguishes a menu form a
navigation link.

The 'Generate' link is currently labeled 'Schedule'.  The other three links are
the same as they are now.  There was some discussion about the left-to-right
order of the links.  This picture is based on order of presumed most frequent
use.
