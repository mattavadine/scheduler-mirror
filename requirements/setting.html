<h2>1.3 Operational Setting</h2>
<p> 
The departments that we visited can be found in Section 
<a href="personnel.html">1.2 System Personnel</a>. Each of these departments will be responsible for maintaining a server that runs the scheduler. This server computer will need to be active 24 hours a day in order for the scheduling tool to be accessed by instructors and administrators at any time. If the server stops working, the program will not be accessible.
</p>
<p>
In order to use the scheduler, an instructor or administrator will use a personal computer to log onto the program. Given that the scheduler will act as a web application for all users, it will be accessible at a specific URL, and login will be authenticated using Cal Poly username and passwords. Once a user has logged in, the scheduler can be used as long as the server machine is running.
