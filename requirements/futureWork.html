2.8 Future Work
</h2>
<body bgcolor = white>
This section details work that is not fully (or  is minimally) documented in the requirements. Future  work consists primarily of  design decisions,  menus, layouts or features that are still being discussed and are not ready for implementation.  Included is information regarding potential changes to the <a href="fileMenu.html">File Menu</a> that have not yet been fully propagated throughout all of the requirements.<br><a name="master">
<h3>2.8.1 Archiving and Trashing of Schedules</h3>
How to resolve handling temporary or extraneous schedules, either by archiving those unneeded shedules, deleting schedules, or some combination of both abilities as well as the location and visual representation of this functionality to the administrator. Deleting schedules will affect all related interfaces (such as Instructors who have associated preferences or who may view the deleted schedule).  Temporary schedules may be deleted by an administrator, useful past schedules should be archived and retrievable without cluttering the view of available schedule documents. <br>

<h3>2.8.2 Integration with PeopleSoft</h3>
Currently the functionality to upload to and download from PeopleSoft is documented in the requirements, but there is no discussion of special cases.

<h3>2.8.3 Look and Feel</h3>
There may be alternate  ways to emphasize the drag-and-drop look-and-feel. Different ways  will develop  based on usability tests and feedback with clients. The following is a list of a few issues related to the  look-and-feel of drag-and-drop ability:
<ul>
<li>The existence of the 'Available' list for schedule generation. (Improved look-and-feel for drag-and-drop schedule generation)</li>
<li>'Available' column of checkboxes in per-term views</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.8.4 Document structure</h3>
How documents are stored is not discussed in the requirements. The following items have been mentioned and need to be addressed:
<ul>
<li>Multiple documents model; 'Open->Recent' item in 'File' menu</li>
<li>Saveless documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.8.5 Merging</h3>
Towards the end of the quarter, it became more clear that a requirement to merge schedules needed to be implemented. Some things that need to be considered are: how conflicts are handled, how the master modifies the merge results, what this looks like from a user perspective.

<h3>2.8.6 Power User Language</h3>
Many clients outlined the desire for a more functional ability to change settings. They want to input powerful and intuitive constraint language that will change settings on a per department basis. This needs to be developed, and a manual for what language is accepted must be written.

<h3>2.8.7 Instructor Interfaces and Preferences</h3>
Currently being designed  are the  Instructor interfaces 
</a></a></a></a></a></a>for viewing schedule documents that have been sent by their administrator and submitting preferences (time, distance, courses) for requested schedule documents if those preferences are considered by the administrator. <br><br>The Instructor's main 'home' view contains a list of viewable documents listed by schedule item (ordered by date modified?). Documents associated with each schedule item are Preferences (if applicable), an indication of a submitted/not submitted state for the preferences (if there is a current request for submission or update of them from the administrator) and a Schedule document. The Schedule document is the viewable schedule of courses, times, etc. If Preferences are not provided for by the administrator, only Schedule documents will be available for viewing. If no documents are available to the Instructor, their document view will display a message to contact their administrator.<br><br>Instructors may continue to submit their preferences until the administrator selects the button to generate; this automatically 'locks' the schedule and subsequently locks submission of instructor preferences for that schedule. There will be an alert to the administrator that generate will lock instructor preferences, and display a warning if there are unsubmitted preferences. <br><br>[inert slide image]<br><br><a name="master"><a name="peoplesoft"><a name="lookandfeel"><a name="document"><a name="merging"><a name="poweruser">
