<h2>
2.8 Future Work
</h2>
<body bgcolor = white>
This section outlines some of the work that is not fully documented in the requirements. Some of the work is minimally documented, while some of it has not been considered at all at this point.

<h3>Master List</h3>
This has been a major point of contention for the class. All requirements were developed assuming that courses, instructors, and locations were stored in a master list that could be accessed by any user of the program. If the master list continues, the following things need to be further detailed:
<ul>
<li>A means to update master from per-term schedules</li>
<li>A means to update per-term from master</li>
</ul>

<h3>Integration with PeopleSoft</h3>
Currently the functionality to upload to PeopleSoft and download from PeopleSoft is documented in the requirements, but there is no discussion of special cases.

<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
There might be a better way to emphasize the drag-and-drop look and feel. This will probably develop in the prototype based on usability tests with clients. The following are a couple look and feel related issues:
<ul>
<li>The existence of the 'Available' list for schedul gen, aka, improved look and feel for drag-and-drop schedule generation</li>
<li>Available column of checkbox in per-term views</li>
</ul>

<h3>Document structure</h3>
How documents are stored is not discussed in the requirements. The following items have been mentioned and need to be addressed:
<ul>
<li>Multiple document model; 'Open->Recent' item in 'File' menu</li>
<li>Saveless documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merging</h3>
Towards the end of the quarter, it became more clear that a requirement to merge schedules needed to be implemented. Some things that need to be considered are: how conflicts are handled, how the master modifies the merge results, what this looks like from a user perspective. 

<h3>Power User Language</h3>
Many clients outlined the desire for a more functional ability to change settings. They want to input powerful and intuitive constraint language that will change settings on a per department basis. This needs to be developed, and a manual for what language is accepted must be written.
