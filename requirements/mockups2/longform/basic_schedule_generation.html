<h3>2.3.3 Schedule generation </h3>
<p>After the user selects the <strong>New Schedule</strong> option from the 
<a href="../walkthru/walkthru-home.html"><font color="black">Home Screen</font></a>, the user is presented with
a list of available <em>Department Courses</em> in the left-most table. The user can drag courses from the <em>Department Courses</em>
table directly onto their preferred time slot on the calendar. If the user prefers for the Scheduling program to allocate the course days and
times automatically, they can either double-click or drag the course onto the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> table on the right.

<p align="left"> Once the user's has populated the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> table, the user presses the <strong>Auto Fill</strong>
button at the bottom of the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> table, to automatically assign all courses found in the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> to specific time slots on the calendar.

<p align="left">After the courses in the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> table are scheduled into the calendar, the <em>Auto-Generate Courses</em> table
is cleared. The courses are displayed in their appropriate time slots and are colored light green, which indicates that the scheduled time is preferred
based on the preferences of an instructor. If the user wishes to get more information about a scheduled course, the user hovers the mouse on a specific
course and additional information <em>(course title, course number/section, course location, course instructor, schedules course time)</em> will appear in a small text box
as shown in <em>Figure 3</em> for CHEM 461.

<h4>2.3.1.1 Schedule Generation Valid Drag</h4>

<p>If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> table directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course meets the university requirements 
and is preferred based on the preferences of the instructor the course is colored bright green. In <em>Figure 4</em> the user is attempting to drag CHEM 252
to the 7AM - 9AM Tuesday/Thursday time slot. Once the user unclicks, the course turns light green and is scheduled 
in the specified time slot and after clicking the <strong>Save Schedule</strong> button the schedule is saved to the database.

<p> If the user places a course on a day that can be scheduled multiple ways the user is presented with a pop-up box to choose the preferred schedule.
In <em>Figure 5</em> the user attempts to schedule CHEM 474 from 7AM - 9AM but the course can be offered on both Monday, Wednesday, Friday or 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday from 7AM - 9AM. In the example the user selects MWR 7AM - 9AM and presses the <strong>Save Schedule</strong> button to save it to the 
database.

<p> If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> table directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course is colored bright orange
while attempting to place the course into a specific time slot it means the course is scheduled in a time that is <em>Not Preferred</em> due to the preferences
of an instructor. In <em>Figure 6</em> the user attempt to schedule CHEM 590 from 9AM - 12PM but the course is not prefered due the preferences of the instructors
in the database. The course is colored bright orange until the user unclicks and places the course in the time slot, then the course is colored light orange.

<p> If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> table directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course is in direct conflict
with the scheduling algorithm, university scheduling constraints, or instructor preferences the course is colored red. Once the user attempts to place the 
course into the time slot the course automatically jumps back to the <em>Department Courses</em> table because it is unable to be scheduled.
