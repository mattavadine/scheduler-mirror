When the user wants to build a brand new schedule, use an existing schedule as a template, or modify a schedule, the user must navigate to the Schedule 
Creation view. In order to navigate to the Schedule Creation user interface, the user must click on the <a href="userInterface.html#user_interface">Schedule tab</a>
located in the Scheduling tool's header at the top of the application. After clicking this tab the user is presented with the option of selecting a new
schedule, using an existing schedule as a starting template, or modifying an existing schedule.
</br></br>
The user has the choice of letting the Scheduling tool assign all courses' time, location, and instructors using the automatic schedule generation feature.
Based off of instructor  preferences, course preferences, and university constraints the Scheduling tool will assign all designated courses to their appopriate
time slots.  The CHEM department is used throughout the requirements scenarios because the CHEM department provides a reasonably representative example of departments across campus.

The uniform coloring designation used throughout this scenario for courses represents the current preference of the scheduled course.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The color distribution is defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>Green = preferred by both department and instructor</li>
<li>Yellow = preferred by department, not-preferred by instructor</li>
<li>Orange = not preferred by department, as well as not-preferred by instructor</li>
<li>Red = not possible, i.e., a hard scheduling conflict</li>
</ul>

<p>After the user selects the <strong>New Schedule</strong> option from the 
<a href="userInterface.html#Home_Screen">Home Screen</a>, the user is presented with the screen show in <a href="#Figure 2.2.1.1">Figure 2.2.1.1</a>.
The courses in <em>Department Courses</em> list are the ones being offered in the current department catalog and are labeled LEC/LAB to reflect
the course has a lecture and lab portion. If the course has no indicator of LEC/LAB it means that the course is a typical Cal Poly lecture with no 
associated lab portion.

<p>The left-most list consists of a list of available <em>Department Courses</em>. The user can drag courses from the <em>Department Courses</em>
list directly onto their preferred time slot on the calendar. If the user prefers that the Scheduling program allocates the course days and
times automatically, they can either double-click or drag the course onto the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list on the right. <a href="#Figure 2.2.1.2">Figure 2.2.1.2</a> 
shows the screen after a user has added one section of CHEM 124 lecture and CHEM 124 lab to the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list.</p>

The drag-and-drop action can be done repeatedly for a single course.  Each time the user drags a course again, it adds another section to be 
offered, and shows the total number of sections to be offered in parentheses after the course.  <a href="#Figure 2.2.1.3">Figure 2.2.1.3</a> shows the result of the user having 
dragged CHEM 110 lab and lecture; and the user having dragged a CHEM 124 lab and lecture for the second time from the <em>Department Courses</em> list to the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list.

<p align="left"> <a href="#Figure 2.2.1.4">Figure 2.2.1.4</a> shows the result of the user having selected a full quarter's worth of courses to be scheduled for Spring 2012.  
These selections were made by performing the drag-drop and editing actions illustrated in Figures 2.2.1.1 through 2.2.1.3.  
Once the user has populated the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list, the user presses the <strong>Generate Schedule</strong>
button at the bottom of the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list, to automatically assign all courses found in the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> to specific time slots on the calendar.

<p align="left">After the courses in the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list are scheduled into the calendar, the <em>Courses to Schedule</em> list
is cleared. The courses are displayed in their appropriate time slots and are colored light green, which indicates that the scheduled time is preferred
based on the preferences of an instructor. If the user wishes to get more information about a scheduled course, the user hovers the mouse on a specific
course and additional information <em>(course title, course number/section, course location, course instructor, schedules course time)</em> will appear in a small text box
as shown in <a href="#Figure 2.2.1.5">Figure 2.2.1.5</a> for CHEM 461.

<p>If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> list directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course meets the university requirements 
and is preferred based on the preferences of the instructor, the course is colored bright green. In <a href="#Figure 2.2.2.1">Figure 2.2.2.1</a> the user is attempting to drag CHEM 252
to the 7AM - 9AM Tuesday/Thursday time slot. Once the user unclicks, the course turns light green and is scheduled 
in the specified time slot and after clicking the <strong>Save Schedule</strong> button the schedule is saved to the database.

<p> If the user drags a course onto the schedule that can be offered over different sets of days during the same time slot, the user is presented with a pop-up box of all available offerings. In <a href="#Figure 2.2.2.2">Figure 2.2.2.2</a> the user attempts to schedule CHEM 474 from 7AM - 9AM but the course can be offered on both Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Monday, Wednesday, Thursday from 7AM - 9AM.

database.

<p> If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> list directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course is colored bright yellow
while attempting to place the course into a specific time slot it means the course is scheduled in a time that is <em>Not Preferred</em> due to the preferences
of an instructor. In <a href="#Figure 2.2.2.3">Figure 2.2.2.3</a> the user attempts to schedule CHEM 316 from 10AM - 12PM on MWF, but the course is not prefered due to the preferences of the instructors in the database. 
The course is colored bright yellow until the user unclicks and places the course in the time slot, then the course is colored light yellow.

<p> If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> list directly onto a time slot

while attempting to place the course into a specific time slot it means the course is scheduled in a time that is <em>Not Preferred</em> due to the preferences
of an instructor and the department. In <a href="#Figure 2.2.2.4">Figure 2.2.2.4</a> the user attempts to schedule CHEM 590 from 9AM - 12PM on TR but the course 
is not prefered due to the preferences of the instructors in the database and the department. The course is colored bright orange until the user unclicks and places the course in the time slot, then the course is colored light orange.

<p> If the user wishes to manually edit the schedule, the user can drag a course from the <em>Department Courses</em> list directly onto a time slot 
on the calendar. The user clicks and holds down on the specific course and drags the selected course onto the calendar. If the course is in direct conflict
with the scheduling algorithm, university scheduling constraints, or instructor preferences the course is colored red. Once the user attempts to place the 
course into the time slot the course automatically jumps back to the <em>Department Courses</em> list because it is unable to be scheduled. In
<a href="#Figure 2.2.2.5">Figure 2.2.2.5</a> the user attempts to drag CHEM 461 from 9AM - 10AM, but the course is <em>Not Possible</em> due to a hard scheduling conflict.
