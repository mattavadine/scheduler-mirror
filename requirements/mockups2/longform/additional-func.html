<h3>2.6.1 Schedule Status Management</h3>

<p align=center> Figure 2.6.1.1: The schedule status modification view </p> 
<hr> 
</a> 
<p>The user will see a list of existing schedules as well as the schedule's current Progress status. The progress can either be <em>In Progress</em>, <em>Proposed</em>, or <em>Official</em>. These three options are shown in a drop drop down as seen in <a href="#Figure 2.6.1.1">Figure 2.6.1.1</a>. An <em>In Progress</em> schedule is a schedule that is still being adjusted. A <em>Proposed</em> schedule indicates a schedule that has been sent to the adminstration to be accepted. After acceptance by the administration, the schedule may be set to <em>Official</em>. When any schedule's status is changed by the administrator, they can then click on </em>Commit</em> to save their change. Update pulls data from PeopleSoft and updates the existing course information.</p>

<h3>2.6.3 Printing and Exporting</h3>

<p>Once a schedule has been created the user has the ability to print the desired view of the schedule or export the schedule to PDF format
or to a comma-delimited text file. If the user wishes to print a schedule, the user must first navigate to the appropriate schedule view
(<a href="ViewRequirements.html#list_view">Schedule List View</a>, <a href="ViewRequirements.html#table_view">Schedule Table View</a>,
 <a href="ViewRequirements.html#weekly_view">Schedule Weekly View</a>, <a href="basic_schedule_generation.html#manual_sched">Schedule Calendar View</a>)
After selecting the appropriate view the user clicks the <strong>Print</strong> button to send the file to the appropriate printer. In order for the user
to export the schedule to either a PDF format or comma-delimited format the user opens the desired schedule and clicks the <em>Export</em> button.
Once the user clicks the export button they are prompted with a text box to specify the name of the output file and also a drop-down menu to select
the desired output <em>(PDF or comma-delimited)</em>. Once the user clicks the <strong>OK</strong> button the file is saved under the appropriate name and destination 
specified by the user.
