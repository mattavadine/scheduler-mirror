User Interface

<p> 
Before an administrator has logged in and chosen which schedule they want to work with, they will be presented with a simple header that is not dynamic, but is mostly just a placeholder.
<br> 
<br> 
<hr> 
<a name="Title Header"> 
<p align=center> 
<img src="images/UI_GreenHeaderOnly.png" border="2"> 
</p> 
<p align=center> Figure 1: Title Header</p> 
<hr> 
</a> 
<br> 
<p>Once the administrator is logged in and has chosen a schedule to work with, they will see the full interface on every page they visit.  At any time they can use the links to jump to another section of the application. </p>
<br>
On the far right of the header they will see the current logged in username, and there will be a link for them to log out.
<p>
The dropdown field shows the current schedule that is selected, and provides an easy way to switch between schedules.
<br>
The Schedule Button will take the administrator to the <a href="basic_schedule_generation.html">Schedule Setup</a> page where the administrator can view, edit and export a schedule.
<br>
The Instructors Button will take the administrator to the <a href="manage-instructors.html">Instructor Overview</a> page where the administrator can manage the Instructors data in the system.
<br>
The Courses Button will take the administrator to the <a href="manage-courses.html">Course Overview</a> page where the administrator can manage the Courses data in the system.
<br>
The Locations Button will take the administrator to the <a href="manage-locations.html">Locatation Overview</a> page where the administrator can manage the Locations data in the system.
</p>

<p>When the administrator clicks on the current schedule name, they will get a drop down menu with all the current schedules, and they can quickly choose to manage another schedule.</p>
