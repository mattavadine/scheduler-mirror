<h3>Add Course</h3>
<p>A new course's information is entered into the text boxes on the bottom row of the course overview list. Once the information is entered, the user must click on the <em>Add</em> button to save the new course to the list.

<p>For added certainty in the delete confirmation view, the prompt includes the course's department and catalog number in addition to the course's name. In order to confirm the deletion of the stated course, the user must select the <em>Yes</em> button. Otherwise, the <em>No</em> button will cancel the deletion attempt. Upon selecting either button, the screen will return back to the <a href="#Manage Courses">Course Overview</a>. If deletion was confirmed, the deleted course will no longer be in the list.
