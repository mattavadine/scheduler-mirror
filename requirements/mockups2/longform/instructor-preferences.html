<p>This screen will list all courses for the department. Beside each course is a drop down with preference options for that specific course. The options are:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Preferred</b> - I am highly qualified and would really like to teach.<br>
<li><b>Acceptable</b> - This is not a priority course, but I am qualified and would not mind teaching.<br>
<li><b>Not Preferred</b> - It would put strain on me, but I could teach if necessary.<br>
<li><b>Not Possible</b> - There is absolutely no way I can teach this course.
</ol>
</p>

<p><em>Acceptable</em> is the default choice for all courses.</p>

<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button.</p>

<p>This screen will show a calendar week view. It allows the user to set an instructor's time preferences. Times are added using the settings at the top.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the week view will be blank indicating a neutral preference for all possible instruction hours. The two text entry boxes allow the user to enter the beginning and ending time of the block they wish to add. The <em>Mon</em>, <em>Tue</em>, <em>Wed</em>, <em>Thu</em>, and <em>Fri</em> checkboxes specify which days of the week for which the block will be added. To the right, above the <em>Add</em> and <em>Delete</em> buttons is a drop down that allows you to choose a preference level from the choices listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Preferred</b> - If there are no other constraints, these are the hours I would like to teach. Will appear as green.</li>
<li><b>Acceptable</b> - Courses scheduled any time in this range are acceptable. Will appear as yellow.</li>
<li><b>Not Preferred</b> - I would require special arrangements due to previous commitments. I can do this only if absolutely necessary. Will appear as orange.</li>
<li><b>Not Possible</b> - There is absolutely no way I can teach during these periods. Will appear as red.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the user is done using the available adjustments to add a chunk of time, they can then click on the <em>Add</em> button. Chunks of time added will appear on the week view. For deletion of chunks of time, the user may click on the chunk and then click on the <em>Delete</em> button.</p>
<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button.</p>

<h3>Distance Preference</h3>
<p>This view as shown in <a href="#Figure 3">Figure 3</a> is reached by clicking on an instructor's <em>Distance</em> button.</p>

</a> 
<br> 
</a>
<p>There are three user input fields on this view. The first input is specifying the preferred center point on the map of the campus for which to apply the distance value given previously. This is done by specifying the building number that the instructor wishes for their courses to be nearest to.</p>
<p>The second input is the numerical value for maximum preferred distance.</p>
<p>The third is a drop down for specifying the distance unit for the value given in the first input. Drop down choices are feet, yards, meters, miles, and kilometers.</p> 
<p>However, if the first input is left blank, then the distance value is used to specify how far apart back-to-back classes can be. For example, say the instructor is willing to walk up to 500 feet. If the instructor has three classes (call them A, B, and C, in that order) to teach in three different classrooms, with no break in between, it is possible that the distance between A-B and B-C is 500 feet each and A-C is 1000 feet.</p>
<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button.</p>
