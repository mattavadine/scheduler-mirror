Once an administrator clicks on any of the instructor preference buttons from an <a href="resource-management.html#edit instructor">edit instructor view</a>, 
they are greeted with the corresponding preference view. The three options for instructor preferences are <a href="instructor-preferences.html#courses">Courses</a>,
<a href="instructor-preferences.html#times">Times</a>, and <a href="instructor-preferences.html#distance">Distance</a>.

<p>This screen will list all courses for the department. Beside each course is a drop down menu with preference options for that specific course. The four options are:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Preferred</b> - I am highly qualified and would really like to teach this course.<br>
<li><b>Acceptable</b> - This is not a priority course, but I am qualified and would not mind teaching.<br>
<li><b>Not Preferred</b> - It would put strain on me, but I could teach this course if necessary.<br>
<li><b>Not Possible</b> - There is absolutely no way I can teach this course.
</ol>
</p>

<p><em>Acceptable</em> is the default choice for all courses.</p>

<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button, which
will ignore all changes made to the preferences.</p>

<h3>2.5.2 Time Preferences</h3>

<p>This screen will show a calendar week view. It allows the user to set an instructor's time preferences. Times are added using the settings at the top.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the week view will be blank, indicating an acceptable preference for all possible instruction hours. The two text entry boxes allow the user to enter the beginning and ending time of the block they wish to add. The <em>Mon</em>, <em>Tue</em>, <em>Wed</em>, <em>Thu</em>, and <em>Fri</em> checkboxes specify which days of the week for which the block will be added.
To the right, above the <em>Add</em> and <em>Delete</em> buttons is a drop down menu that allows you to choose a preference level from the choices listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Preferred</b> - If there are no other constraints, these are the hours I would like to teach. Any course scheduled during this time for this professor will appear as <strong>green</strong>
on the schedule.</li>
<li><b>Acceptable</b> - Courses scheduled any time in this range are acceptable. Any course scheduled during this time for this professor will appear as <strong>yellow</strong>
on the schedule.</li>
<li><b>Not Preferred</b> - I would require special arrangements due to previous commitments. I can do this only if absolutely necessary. Any course scheduled during this time for this professor will appear as <strong>orange</strong>
on the schedule.</li>
<li><b>Not Possible</b> - There is absolutely no way I can teach during these periods. Any course scheduled during this time for this professor will appear as <strong>red</strong>
on the schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the user is done making the available adjustments to add a block of time, they can then click on the <em>Add</em> button. Blocks of time added will appear on the week view. For deletion of blocks of time, the user may click on the block and then click on the <em>Delete</em> button.</p>
<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button, which
will ignore all changes made to the preferences.</p>

<h3>2.5.3 Distance Preference</h3>
<p>The view that is shown in <a href="#Figure 2.5.3.1">Figure 2.5.3.1</a> is reached by clicking on an instructor's <em>Distance</em> button from the 
<a href="resource-management.html#edit instructor">edit instructor view</a>.</p> 
<hr> 
<a name="Figure 2.5.3.1">

<p align=center> Figure 2.5.3.1: Instructor distance preference </p> 
<hr> 
</a> 
</a>
<p>There are three user input fields on this view. The first input is specifying the preferred center point on the map of the campus for which to apply the distance value that was previously given. This is done by specifying the building number that the instructor wishes for their courses to be nearest to.</p>
<p>The second input is the numerical value for maximum preferred distance.</p>
<p>The third is a drop down menu for specifying the distance unit for the value given in the first input. Drop down choices are feet, yards, meters, miles, and kilometers.</p> 
<p>However, if the first input is left blank, then the distance value is used to specify how far apart back-to-back classes can be. For example, say the instructor is willing to walk up to 500 feet. If the instructor has three classes (call them A, B, and C, in that order) to teach in three different classrooms, with no break in between, it is possible that the distance between A-B and B-C is 500 feet each and A-C is 1000 feet.</p>
<p>When the preferences have been set, the user must select the <em>Save</em> button to save the changes. Otherwise, select the <em>Cancel</em> button, which
will ignore all changes made to the preferences.</p>
