         When the user launches the scheduling program, the program displays its
start-up screen.  The commands along the left of the screen are the main
functions of the program.  The <strong>Home</strong> screen is where the
scheduling process begins.  The <strong>Schedule</strong> commands allow the
user to to <em>Build</em>, <em>View</em>, and <em>Edit</em> a schedule.
The <strong>Manage</strong> commands allow the user to create and edit
information for <em>Instructors</em>, <em>Courses</em>, and
course <em>Locations</em>.  To get to the Home screen, the user logs in.

         After successful login, the program presents the <strong>Home</strong> screen.
The user first selects the quarter and year to generate a scheduler for.  Then
the user can either select a previous quarter as the basis for the new
schedule, or generate a new schedule from scratch.  In this case, let's suppose
the user presses the New Schedule Button.

         <h2>stewart Schedule Generation (Blank)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
         After opening up a New Schedule, the user is presented with a blank calendar view and a list of all possible department courses (shown on the left). Courses can be dragged from the Department Courses
         list directly onto the calendar, or into the Autofill Courses list. 
      </p>
   </div>
   
   <div id="blurb">

         <h2>stewart Schedule Setup (Populated)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
         Once a user has dragged courses into the Autofill Courses section, the list of courses can be placed in the schedule by clicking on the Auto Fill button. This will schedule all courses in the Autofill Courses
         list, and take into account any classes that already exist on the calendar so that no conflicts occur.
      </p>
   </div>
   
   <div id="blurb">

         <h2>stewart Schedule Setup (Accepted)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
           When a user drags a course onto the calendar, the program verifies that there aren't any conflicts with the proposed schedule. If the schedule does not contain any conflicts, the course
           is added to the calendar. In this instance, CHEM 252 has been added to the schedule. The course is colored light grey to represent that the scheduled time is preferred based on the 
           preferences of an instructor.
      </p>

         <h2>stewart Schedule Setup (Not Preferred)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
           In this case, the user has scheduled CHEM 590 in a time that is not preferred due to the preferences of an instructor. CHEM 590 is colored dark gray to represent this.
      </p>
   </div>
   
   <div id="blurb">

         <h2>stewart Schedule Setup (Hover)</h2>

           The user can move the mouse over courses to see additional information. Here the user has rolled over CHEM 461, Section 1.

      </p>
      <p>
           If a course can be offered over different sets of days during the same time slot, a window pops up that asks the user
           to pick the desired schedule for the course. Here the user has chosen to offer CHEM 474 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

         <h2>stewart Schedule Setup (Drag Select Alternate)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>

           In this case the user has offered CHEM 474 on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday instead of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

        This is a tabular view of a generated schedule. The user can search for particular information, and filter information in or out. The user can also directly edit a generated schedule. The scheduling program oversees the edits, warning about any scheduling
        conflicts that may arise.

When the user selects 'Instructors' in the main menu, the program displays an
overview of the instructors in the department.      </p>

          When a user presses the '<em>Delete</em>' button, this confirmation window will popup, verifying that
          the user wants to remove the instructor from the schedule.

      <p>
To edit an instructor, the user selects the instructor's name and presses the
'Edit' button.  The program highlights the editable fields, where the user
enters the desired new data.  The program also adds a row of buttons below the
instructor's information.  These buttons provide access to instructor
preferences for <em>Courses</em>, <em>Times</em>, and <em>Distance</em> between
classes.      </p>

      <p>
           When the user presses the '<em>Courses</em>' button on the preceding screen,
the program displays this dialog.  For a user acting as department scheduler,
the edits can be performed for any instructor.  When individual instructors run
the scheduling program, they set their own preferences.  The instructor-set
preferences are the default values used for scheduling.  Note that a department
scheduler can only edit preferences for a particular schedule, not the
instructor's permanent stored preferences.

      <p>
           When the user presses the '<em>Edit Preferences: Time</em>' button, the program
           displays this dialog.  As with course preferences, the edits can be performed by
           two different categories of users.  Department schedulers edit time preferences
           only for a particular working schedule.  Instructors edit their own
           preferences, which are the default values unless changed by the department
           scheduler for a particular quarter.

         <h2>chang Instructor Prefs (Distance)</h2>
         <div id="links"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
           The user defines an instructor's distance preference by specifying a reference
building on campus, and the maximum distance from that building that the
instructor would prefer to travel.  When generating a schedule, the program
will try to assign the instructor's courses to rooms that are within the given
distance from the reference building.
