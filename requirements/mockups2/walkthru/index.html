A Walk-Through of Scheduling Program Features
</font></strong></p>
<br>
<p>
Welcome to the initial walk-through of the Cal Poly scheduling program.  The
screens in this walk-through are our initial ideas for features that may be
useful in a class scheduling program.
</p><p>
The index below has links to the screens.  Each screen page has 'Next' and
'Prev' links that traverse through the screens in a helpful order.
As you explore, please keep in mind that this is a first draft of our ideas.
It is very far from a production version of the program.
</p><p>
We are very interested in any feedback you may wish to provide.  For
instructions on using the PolyLearn feedback forum, please see the
