Below is a list of the more general features that were established at the start of the project: 
</p>

<p> 
During initial phase one interviews, each department was asked to explain their scheduling procedure and suggest features and tools that would be useful to them. After interviewing all departments participating in the project, the following feature matrix was designed to reflect the overall importance of the program's features.
</p>
<p>
Each feature is ranked on a scale of -2 to 2, representing the following:
<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp;2:</b> This feature is mandatory. The program is not considered functional without this features.
<li><b>&nbsp;1:</b> This feature is a priority. Most departments have expressed an interest in this feature and it should be supported.
<li><b>&nbsp;0:</b> This feature is optional. Certain departments have mentioned this feature as a nice add-on, but it is not neccessary.
<li><b>-1:</b> This feature is not important. It was mentioned, but contributes little to the functionality of the program.
<li><b>-2:</b> This feature is not useful. It was mentioned, but is not appropraite to the goals of tool.
</ul>
