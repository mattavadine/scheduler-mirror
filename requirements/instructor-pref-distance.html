<p>In this view, the instructor is able to click on a location on the given map for which they prefer their classes to be nearest and set how near the classes have to be (as a radius). Afterwards, the user can either save what they have done or cancel.</p>

<p>There are three user input fields on this view. The first input is the numerical value for maximum preferred distance. The second is a drop down for specifying the distance unit for the value given in the first input. Drop down choices are feet, yards, meters, miles, and kilometers. The third input is specifying the preferred center point on the map of the campus for which to apply the distance value given previously.</p> 
<p>However, if no center point is chosen then the distance value is used to specify how far apart back-to-back classes can be. For example, say the instructor is willing to walk up to 500 feet. If the instructor has three classes (call them A, B, and C, in that order) to teach in three different classrooms, with no break in between, it is possible that the distance between A-B and B-C is 500 feet each and A-C is 1000 feet.</p>
