<!--Explain Figure 3-->
<p>
The user is presented with two windows: The primary work space window, with a menu bar across the top edge and the work space area left blank; a splash screen, listing several primary functions the scheduling administrator may select to quickly get to work. If the user chooses to bypass the splash screen by closing it, an  work space remains within the primary window, at which point the user may use the top-most menu bar to direct his/her efforts. If the user wishes to not be presented with the splash screen at startup, he may uncheck the <font face="Monospace">Display at startup</font> dialogue at the bottom left corner of the splash screen.

<p>
The <font face="Monospace">Edit</font> menu contains commands pertaining to some of the more basic tools of the scheduler program. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Undo</font> undo's the most recent action on the schedule by the user. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Redo</font> redo's the most recent action which had <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Undo</font> applied to it. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Cut</font> takes the current, cursor-selected object and remove it, placing it in memory on a "clipboard". <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Copy</font> takes the current, cursor-selected object and copies it into memory on a "clipboard". <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Paste</font> takes the most recent addition to the clipboard (either by <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Cut</font> or <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Paste</font> and places it at the most appropriate place nearest the current position of the cursor (provided a <font face="Monospace">Paste</font> operation is currently allowed in a given setting. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Find</font> opens a display whereby the user may search for a particular item with the schedule (professor name, raw text displayed in the schedule, a particular class, etc.). <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Select All</font> highlights all available objects in the area surrounding the cursor's current position, or around the window which currently has the "focus". <font face="Monospace">Edit--Preferences</font> opens a display whereby the user can configure the inner workings of the Scheduler Tool (general settings, font settings, default display settings, etc.).  
</p>

<!--View-->
<p>
The <font face="Monospace">View</font> menu contains commands to reorganize how the current schedule-project is viewed. <font face="Monospace">View-->Course, View-->Instructor, </font>and <font face="Monospace">View-->Room #</font> reorganize the schedule's view to display it according to criteria to be specified in a subsequent window. . <font face="Monospace">View-->Course</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to a classes letter acronym (CPE, CSC, SE, etc.) and corresponding numerical identifier (101, 102...308, 415, etc.). <font face="Monospace">View-->Instructor</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to professor's names. <font face="Monospace">View-->Room #</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to which rooms various classes are held in. <font face="Monospace">View-->Conflicts</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with an illustration of which shifts are in conflict with one another (i.e. an instructor is scheduled to teach two classes at the same time, or a room has been assigned for two different classes at the same time).
</p>

<!--Schedule-->
<p>
The <font face="Monospace">Schedule</font> menu contains commands which pertain primarily to the administration of the Scheduler's database of information. Within the <font face="Monospace">Schedule-->[Class/Instructor/Room]</font> menus, a user may add, edit, or remove information regarding new or already-existing classes, instructors, or rooms (respectively). Here, it should be noted that any changes made apply to a "working copy" of the original data: that is, the data changed in one schedule does not implicitly propogate into others.<font face="Monospace">Schedule-->Constraints</font> opens a display whereby the user may create, edit, delete, and prioritize the rules by which a generated schedule <i>must</i> apply. <font face="Monospace">Schedule-->Generate</font> opens a display whereby a user may specify any of several of the following sample options: Which classes should be included/excluded (all?), which professors should be included/excluded (all?), which constraints should be factored in/out (all?), etc. <br>
<br>
Particular to the instructor-view, <font face="Monospace">Schedule-->My Preferences</font> displays a dialogue whereby an instructor may edit his/her personal information and preferences within the scheduler's database. Information altered here by an instructor is permanently changed in the scheduler's database. <br>
<br>
It should be noted that, though professors have the ability to generate schedules, they do not have the authority to publish said schedules: this features is provided in order to allow professors to make projections about possible schedules they may like, prefer, think advantageous to the department, etc.
