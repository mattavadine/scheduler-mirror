<h3>2.6.1 Creating a New Schedule</h3>

<p>A user may create a new schedule by selecting the <b>New</b> option under the file menu.  Once the user selects the New option, a blank schedule view will appear with "Untitled" listed under the schedule name.</p>

</a>

<a name="open_sched">
<h3>2.6.2 Opening an Existing Schedule</h3>

<p>A user may open an existing schedule by selecting the <b>Open...</b> option under the file menu.  Once a user selects the Open... option, an Open Schedule screen will load.  The Open Schedule screen will contain a list of all existing schedules in the system.  Once the user selects the schedule they want to open from the list, the <b>Open</b> button can be pressed to load the specified schedule.  Additionally, the Open Schedule screen will also contain <b>New Schedule</b> and <b>Import</b> buttons in the upper right portion of the screen if the user decides to create a new schedule or import an existing schedule instead of opening an existing schedule in the system. </p>

<h3>2.6.3 Saving a Schedule</h3>

<p>Both the <b>Save</b> and <b>Save As...</b> options under the file menu provide saving functionality for schedules.  In order to use these options the user needs to have a schedule opened.  If the open shedule has never been saved before, the Save As... dialog menu will appear if the user selects the Save or Save As... option (See <b>Figure 2.6.3.1</b>).  This dialog prompts the user to specify a name to save the schedule as.  If the open schedule has been previously saved, the Save option will perform a quick save on the schedule without prompting the user for any information, however, the Save As... option will still prompt the user to enter a name to save the schedule as and will make a new save instance of the schedule under this provided name.</p>

<h3>2.6.4 Importing a Schedule from File</h3>

<p>A user may import a schedule that has been previously exported by selecting the <b>Import...</b> option under the file menu.  Once the user selects the Import option, a dialog box appears prompting the user to specify a file to import (See <b>Figure 2.6.4.1</b>).  This file will be a previously exported CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.  The user selects a file to import, presses the <b>Submit</b> button, and the selected schedule file is imported and displayed.</p>

<h3>2.6.5 Downloading a Schedule</h3>

<!--<p>Once a schedule has been created the user has the ability to print the desired view of the schedule or export the schedule to PDF format
or to a comma-delimited text file. If the user wishes to print a schedule, the user must first navigate to the appropriate schedule view
(<a href="ViewRequirements.html#list_view">Schedule List View</a>, <a href="ViewRequirements.html#table_view">Schedule Table View</a>,
 <a href="ViewRequirements.html#weekly_view">Schedule Weekly View</a>, <a href="basic_schedule_generation.html#manual_sched">Schedule Calendar View</a>).
After selecting the appropriate view the user clicks the <strong>Print</strong> button to send the file to the appropriate printer. In order for the user
to export the schedule to either a PDF format or comma-delimited format, the user opens the desired schedule and clicks the <strong>Export</strong> button.
Once the user clicks the export button, they are prompted with a text box to specify the name of the output file and a drop-down menu to select
the desired output <em>(PDF or comma-delimited)</em>. Once the user clicks the <strong>OK</strong> button, the file is saved under the appropriate name and destination 
specified by the user.
