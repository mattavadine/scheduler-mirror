		<h2>2.7 Installation</h2>
		<p> 
			The Scheduling Project has two components - a server and a client.
		</p>
		
		<a name="server">
		<h3>2.7.1 Server Installation</h3>
		<p>
			The server component of the Scheduling Project is a Java project.
			Each department will need to install the server on a computer they
			control, with the following minimum requirements:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<!-- The Mac requirement can probably be lower. -->
			<li>Windows XP, Mac OS X 10.6, Linux</li>
			<li>Java 1.6</li>
			<!-- To serve anything on port 80, we need root privs on Linux.  We
			need to investigate this for the other OSs. -->
			<li>Open port 80 for non-local use</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Scheduling Project will only be accessible when the server is
			running, so departments will likely wish to choose a computer that
			stays on 24/7.
		</p>

		<a name="client">
		<h3>2.7.2 Client Installation</h3>
		<p>
			The Scheduling Project client is a web application; no additional
			software installation is required if the system meets the following
			minimum requirements:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<!-- These should be browsers that we can and will test. -->
			<li>Internet Explorer 8, Mozilla Firefox 3.5, Google Chrome, Safari
			5.1</li>
			<li>1024x768 or 1280x800 screen resolution</li>
			<li>A network connection to the server</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The client will also be available as a simple desktop application.
			In addition to the above requirement, the desktop application will
			require administrator privileges to install.
		</p>
