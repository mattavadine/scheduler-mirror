<!--Intro Figure 5: Initial Window-->
<p>
When invoked by a student, the Scheduler Tool displays an initial screen, illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
<hr>
<a name="Student splash screen">

<!--Explain Figure 5-->
<p>
The user is presented with two windows: The primary work space window, with a menu bar across the top edge and the work space area left blank; a splash screen, listing several primary functions the scheduling administrator may select to quickly get to work. If the user chooses to bypass the splash screen by closing it, an  work space remains within the primary window, at which point the user may use the top-most menu bar to direct his/her efforts. If the user wishes to not be presented with the splash screen at startup, he may uncheck the <font face="Monospace">Display at startup</font> dialogue at the bottom left corner of the splash screen.
</p>

<!--Intro Figure 6: Menu Bar Explanation-->
<p>
Below, Figure 6 shows an expansion of the top-level menu bar.

<!--File-->
<p>
The <font face="Monospace">File</font> menu contains commands regarding the general management of the scheduler's files and projects. <font face="Monospace">File-->Open Project</font> opens a display by which the user may select and open an already-created schedule project. <font face="Monospace">File-->Recent</font> opens a drop-down menu next to the <font face="Monospace">Recent</font> selection, listing several recently edited/opened schedule projects. Students cannot edit these schedules: they are opened in a "read-only" format. <font face="Monospace">File-->Save</font> commits any changes made to a project and save them to the appropriate file name. <font face="Monospace">File--> Save As...</font> opens a display whereby the user may save their project under a name different than its current one. <font face="Monospace">File-->Print</font> opens a display whereby the user may selections option to print all or parts of a schedule project. <font face="Monospace">File-->Print Preview</font> opens a display which illustrates how the schedule would look if printed with the current printer settings. <font face="Monospace">File-->Close Project</font> closes the current schedule project, asking the user whether he/she wishes to save his/her current work. Scheduler remains open, with a blank work space. <font face="Monospace">File-->Exit</font> closes the Scheduler program, querying the user as to whether he/she wishes to save his/her work.
</p>

<!--Edit-->
<p>
The <font face="Monospace">Edit</font> menu contains commands pertaining to some of the more basic tools of the scheduler program. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Undo</font> undo's the most recent action on the schedule by the user. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Redo</font> redo's the most recent action which had <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Undo</font> applied to it. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Cut</font> takes the current, cursor-selected object and remove it, placing it in memory on a "clipboard". <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Copy</font> takes the current, cursor-selected object and copies it into memory on a "clipboard". <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Paste</font> takes the most recent addition to the clipboard (either by <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Cut</font> or <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Paste</font> and place it at the most appropriate places nearest the current position of the cursor (provided a <font face="Monospace">Paste</font> operation is currently allowed in a given setting. <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Find</font> opens a display whereby the user may search for a particular item with the schedule (professor name, raw text displayed in the schedule, a particular class, etc.). <font face="Monospace">Edit-->Select All</font> highlights all available objects in the area surrounding the cursor's current position, or around the window which currently has the "focus". <font face="Monospace">Edit--Preferences</font> opens a display whereby the user can configure the inner workings of the Scheduler Tool (general settings, font settings, default display settings, etc). 
</p>

<!--View-->
<p>
The <font face="Monospace">View</font> menu contains commands to reorganize how the current schedule-project is viewed. <font face="Monospace">View-->Course, View-->Instructor, </font>and <font face="Monospace">View-->Room #</font> reorganize the schedule's view to display it according to criteria to be specified in a subsequent window. . <font face="Monospace">View-->Course</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to a classes letter acronym (CPE, CSC, SE, etc.) and corresponding numerical identifier (101, 102...308, 415, etc.). <font face="Monospace">View-->Instructor</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to professor's names. <font face="Monospace">View-->Room #</font> reorganizes the schedule's representation to present the user with a schedule sorted according to which rooms various classes are held in. 
</p>

<!--Schedule-->
<p>
It should be noted that, unlike the schedule administrator and instructor views, the student view does not have the <font face="Monospace">Schedule</font> pull-down available. This is because students are not given access to schedule generation (even non-permanent).
