Hello!

<p>Welcome to the prototype walkthrough of the Cal Poly scheduling system.
<br>Use the index below to view the mockups. While you explore, please keep in mind that this is a prototype. It is not even close to the production level software that you are accustomed to seeing and working with. However, it should provide a fair representation of the operation of the final program. Please provide any feedback you have to the scheduler forum, located at
<a href="http://.edu">UNKNOWN</a>

<p>Use the previous and back buttons on each screen to navigate the walkthrough.
<br>If you want to learn more about a screen, click the 'Read more' link.
