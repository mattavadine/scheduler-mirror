<h3><u>2.8.3. Open Recent</u></h3>

<p>
When the user selects <font face="Monospace">File-->Open Recent</font>, the Schedule Tool opens a side-menu displaying up to the last 5 schedule projects successfully opened by the user. If less then 5 schedules have been opened, the window will shrink to accomodate what entries it can. Below, Figure 103 illustrates this menu. It is assumed that the user has previously created and saved two other schedules named "<font face="Monospace">Winter_2010</font>" and "<font face="Monospace">Spring_2010</font>".

If no schedules have yet been opened, the Open Recent menu will display a single, greyed out entry "<font face="Monospace">None</font>", as illustrated in Figure 104.

<p>
Upon selection of a file in the Open Recent dialog, the Scheduler Tool will go about the operations necessary to open the file. For details regarding the process of opening a file, please refer to <a href="">Section 2.8.2</a>. Each entry appears as its root filename, less any leading file path and less any filename extension. Thus, a schedule stored in "<font face="Monospace">/home/admin/scheduler/MyBestSchedule.stf</font>" would appear in the Open Recent menu as "<font face="Monospace">MyBestSchedule</font>".
