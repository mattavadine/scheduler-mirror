<h3><u>2.8.8. Exit</u></h3>
<p>
When the user selects the <font face="monospace">Exit</font> command in the <font face="monospace">File</font> menu, the system begins by checking for an open Scheduler project. If an open project exists, the system saves this project as the default project. When the user launches the Scheduler in the future, this project is opened by default. If an open project exists, the system proceeds by executing the <font face="monospace">Close Project</font> command. The associated processing for <font face="monospace">Close Project</font> ensues, including any necessary user interaction with a warning dialog. This is described in section <a href="close.html">2.8.7. Close Project</a>. If the user responds at a point such that <font face="monospace">Close Project</font> is canceled for the current, open project, the <font face="monospace">Exit</font> operation is also thereby canceled. Once the <font face="monospace">Close Project</font> command has run to completion, the system proceeds with the <font face="monospace">Exit</font> operation. The system terminates the current session of the Scheduler, thereby returning the user to the underlying operating environment.
