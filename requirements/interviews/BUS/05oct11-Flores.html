<h1>Interview with Dolores Flores</h1>
<h1>10:00am October 5th, 2011</h1>
<div class=interview>
	<p><b>Attendance: </b>Michael McMahon(402), David Seltzer(402)</p>
	
	<div class=question>Interviewer: So we have this check list which we'd basically like you just to go through and at the end we'll get additional information you may have</div>
	
<div class="DF">Flores: Ok, now what - And I was asking him, now what is the purpose of the scheduling-software project?</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: Its to make scheduling easier.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores: At the college level?</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: Yes.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores: Ok, so do you want me to just go ahead and answer these questions?</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: Yeah, is that what you want to do? That's fine?</div>
<div class="DF">Flores: Ok, so, who besides myself does scheduling in my department? Ok, I guess I should explain how it's done, I maintain it pretty much on an ongoing basis for the entire college.  So all departments report to me whenever they are submiting a change or requesting that I look for a room.  For the intitial phase, we have the planning phase.  What I do is I copy last years spreadsheet and send it to them- to the department and area chairs- for them to update for the coming quarter.  So at that point they go over it to decided what courses to offer, who's going to teach them, and then they send the spreadsheet back to me.  So I get six spread sheets, because we have six areas, plus a seventh one for graduate programs.  So accounting, marketing, management, industrial technology, econ, and finance, and graduate programs so there's seven areas.  As far as names, do you need names on this?</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: Yes </div>
<div class="DF">Flores: So the administrators for each of the areas send them to me, so I guess, for them, for example, for graduate programs it'd be Vicky Walls, accounting and marketing is Norinne Cruzak, econ and finance is Shelia Smith, industrial technology and management is Sandy Edar.  I can give you a copy of the roster for their contact.  </div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  How do we do scheduling?  So like I said, I send them a spreadsheet which is a copy of last year's they update it and send it back to me.  I put it all together, I'm using Access, Microsoft access, to maintain the schedules so I put it all together in there and then run, clean it up make sure that all the rooms and times and dates are look, correct based on the requirements for each class. So some class can meet for four hours a week, other ones have to meet for three hours a week, and then there's labs and activities which meet for various hours.  So I do all those checks and then I run a room grid from Access to see where I have any conflicts as far as rooms.   They do get rooms allocated, time slots in those rooms allocated for each area, there should not be any conflicts as far as times.  We give them the days and the times you have in these rooms.  However, there still exists, being exsits, being that not all these classes will fit into these rooms perfectly.  When I run the room grid I can see if there's any conflicts with time.  And then if I have anything that's open that maybe another class can use then I fit it in that way.  So in a sense sort of putting the whole puzzle together.  Since I started putting it in Microsoft Access it's really helpped me in trying to keep it organized and like I said looking for conflicts and also able to run reports and be able to sort and filter things in all different ways.  So if the new software can have any of those features that would be great.  Especially creating rubrics from the data that is keyed in.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: Our goal is to generate one exactly when the times should be so there shouldn't be any conflicts.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Now will this be something the college will be able to access ongoing and will it refresh PeopleSoft and vice versa.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  I don't think it's connected to PeopleSoft right now.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Oh that's sad.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer: It's going to be just for generating schedules.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  So it's just going to be for in-house maintinance to run the schedules.<div class=question>Interviewer:  Yeah, it's going to be so you have you're list of classes, your list of professors and then it just generates the best match schedule so there's no conflicts and teachers get their preferences.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  That's something we need.</div>  
<div class="DF">Flores:  Is it done by faculty, staff or both?  No facult is not invovled as far as creating the schedule.  They do have a lot of input as far as when they need and want to teach.</div>  
<div class="DF">Flores:  What roles do they each play?  So staff is invovled and the administrative support coordinators during the planning phase and then they help me with data entry into Peoplesoft.</div>  
<div class="DF">Flores:  What aspects of scheduling are most time consuming?  When it comes to having them make any changes or trying to resolve either conflict or just any type of issues regarding either adding a new course or having to make some changes either by having to change times and dates.  I would say that's the most time consuming because we get the request from the areas then I change my database accordingly then I submit it to class scheduling then they update then they respond with, confirm it with whether or not it's something they could do.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  So it's pretty quick to set it up intially then they change when things arise.  That's what causes problems?</div>
FLores:  Well if this software package could make it easier when the areas could submit what they want on their end and then it all comes together rather us having to do all the data entry then that would make life easier, and reduce the time that's required to do the planning phase.  But yeah, changes throughout the quarter can be time consuming because of the process.  You have to wait for the areas to request change, then you submit it, then it's confirmed, then you submit it.  It's gotten alot better, they've ironed out all the kinks in that.  I think it's going alot better, alot faster.</div>
FLores:  What resources are you using to do scheduling?  I use Excel and Microsoft Access.   Access is what has saved me from alot of work becuase it's been easy to sort and filter and create other reports and create room grids from that.  It has saved me alot of work.  So having a database like that.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Are you satisfied with the scheduling process now?  It's better, but I think it could be even better, where the areas can maintain it on their end without causing major issues for the college or even for university scheduling.</div> 
<div class="DF">Flores:  Do you have any particular ideas for the kinds of features you would like?  Like I mentioned it would be ideal if the areas could submit their schedules themselves when we're creating it at the begginning of the planning phase and then the dean's office being able to manage and maintain it, kind of the way I do it now, but also being able to create room grids to see what's going on in all the classes, to see where we could either eliminate conflicts or being able to utilize the space to the most efficent manner that we can and then able to create reports from that.  So either, a class schedule or anything, faculty, for example faculty roster, or faculty schedule more than a roster, to see what their schedule is for each quarter.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  So you have the five or six departments and then you have to look for any conflicts, so do they schedule the classrooms as well?</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Well, what submit to me is a spreadsheet that looks like this, and then hey give me the information on what classes they're offering, what times, what days, which classrooms and that's based on the allocated room assignments that have been given or assinged to each area.  So they send that in, or submit it to us in the dean's office and then I take it and compile this huge spreadsheet that I copy and paste into Access.  Then from Access I'm able to create room grids, it's not perfect, but it kind of works that way.  Then I'm able to create reports, which makes it easier from Access.  So the ideal features from my scheduling software tool would be somewhere along those lines where the areas can submit something directly into that software package and where the dean's office able to manipulate it and maintain it and then produce a schedule that would be submitted to university scheduling for that quarter.  And then also any changes, if I make a change, it would also be ideal if they were able to see the change immediately, rather than right now they have to wait until they actually see it pop on either PASS or Peoplesoft.  It would eliminate the "Was that change sumbitted?", and "When will that show up on PASS?" and "When can the students sign up for it?" and "What's the class number?".  It will eliminate alot of that waiting period.  And like I said if there was a way to also run reports from that just to see their a schedule for each of the areas, an instructor schedule, maybe then to generate a report to see what the course load is for each instructor.  So something kind of like that.  So that we can see what their course-load is for each quarter.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  Kind of almost like student schedules, but for a professor.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Yes, because each quarter they have to teach so many classes that they are given some time off for research.  But it's a matter of balance, they can teach some times two classes a quarter, but in a sense have the third class off to do research, or they might teach three classes one quarter.  Anyway, it would be nice to what their course load is for the year in a quick snapshot.  Right now we can see it in Peoplesoft but you have search it by each instructor.  I don't know if there's anything off of Dashboard's yet, but I guess that might be the next step.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Concerns about scheduling jobs being taken over by software?  I don't think so, I think alot of the areas would like to have something that makes their job easier when it comes to scheduling and they would be happy to see something that's immediate and quick, especailly when they submit a change to see how it effects their entire schedule, and to be able to confirm to the faculty that a change has been made just for their own planning purposes.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Will faculty be open to interacting with the software scheduling tool? I would think so, I don't know.  They're involved with putting in their requests to teach certain times, certain classes, certain days.  Maybe something that they could view immediately, especailly for those courses that are not even on pass but maybe for them to view.  They could see ahead what we're planning for Spring quarter.</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  They can submit their preferences and then have a view-only of what the schedule's going to be.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Right, kind of see what's been forcasted for them.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Have you had an unsatisfactory experience with scheduling software?  In my deptartment I know that they tried a scheduling software years ago but that was before I got here.  As far as unsatisfactory experiences, I know that there's a program that I think somebody created in the college of science and math that is available for everybody to use and somepeople do like that, I've never used it but I did view it one time to see the schedule but for me I need to see something that is immediate, in other words if a change has been done by University scheduling I like to be able to see it right away and I think that one was refreshed every night, or every other night, or something like that.  And it seems very flexable, versitile, so some people in here used it.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  So you're going to put all this together and then you want us to review those requirements?</div>
<div class=question>Interviewer:  Right during week four and week seven we're going to try to put something out for you guys to review, I think it'd only be an hour during three weeks during the quarter.  Just to kind of see if everything matches up with what you're looking for.</div>
<div class="DF">Flores:  Yeah I think I should have the time if you need me to do that, just let me know and I can put it on my calendar.  As Fall quarter progresses, it becomes easier as far as time available, so yeah I should be able to.</div>
