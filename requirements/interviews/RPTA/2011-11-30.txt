Used /usability/

Clicked "new from csv" instead of new - no cancel button.
"This is nice" on scheduler view; "equivalent to my Excel spreadsheet"
"Can you do these [classes on grid] in different colors?"
Rules (how many classes can be offered when) are important
  - doesn't want a faculty interface for setting preferences

Bug: extra class got added to schedule
Need to add better feedback when a class is on the schedule, but you're trying to add it to second list
Need throbber when dragging classes and things are recalculating

Would rather schedule things herself than fix our algorithm
Not obvious what filters were
  - filters appear to be broken
Add new courses every catalog cycle (2 years), but only then
There are classes offered every fall, every winter, etc.

Currently, the courses offered roll fall-to-fall, but times don't.  This department is fairly consistent; would rather have schedule prepopulated (and movable).

*Max enrollment* and *enrollment limit* are separate, to allow crashing courses.

No ownership of rooms, but does borrow some.

Might need to do something about cross-listed classes.

My note:  URL is always the same, so you can't copy+paste to someone else

Would not use instructor prefs, even as admin.  Most professors have specified classes they teach.

New version of PeopleSoft is coming - should check when doing import/export research.

Should have enrollment limit same for lecture and lab (at least by default).

Willing to do at least one more interview next quarter.
