<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<p>1. The Graphic Communication Department has a faculty scheduling committee.  This committee consists of three faculty members (Information below).  Most of the decision making powers lie with the Chair of the committee.  The committee is in charge of figuring out which classes will be held.  The finalized schedule then goes to Korla and she does the data entry.
</p>
<p>2. Faculty schedules don&apos;t change from year to year.  Schedules can take forever to create.  First, a schedule is planned out and sent to faculty for approval.  This process alone can take 4-5 weeks.  After this whole process, Takes the finalized schedule and enters it all into PeopleSoft.  She really hates having to enter data into Peoplesoft.  The process needs to be intuitive.  Peoplesoft doesn&apos;t allow the use of words like major.  Korla goes up to admin to do scheduling (data entry).  Performing data entry in department office is really tough.  Fields populating automatically in Peoplesoft Korla likes.
</p> 
<p>3. It would be nice to automatically populate class list and not have to reenter everything. Lecturers run into time issues and can lead to timing flip-flops.  Faculty might have some problems changing to new system.  Scheduling committee has a hard time with pre-reqs and can&apos;t overlap the pre-reqs for the students.  Students give lots of feedback when this happens.  Faculty (full time) have can have three different schedules: MWF, TH, or TWH if you&apos;re on the scheduling committee.  Faculty should be able to specify which days they can teach.  System should try to get rid of Peoplesoft or take what functionality it has.  The Graphic Communication Department uses the Lantiv scheduler.  It would be nice for the implemented system to sync with the Lantiv system.
</p>
<p>4. Positive: Takes less time to do the schedule especially if it can double check pre-reqs and other constraints.<br />Negative:  Faculty resistant to change.
</p>
<p>5. Nothing to add.</p>
<p>6. Would be willing to spend an hour during weeks 4, 7, 10 to go over progress.
