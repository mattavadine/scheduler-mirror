Interviewer: Jason Stewart(402), Stephen Baldwin(308)
Interviewees: Suzy Black (sublack@calpoly.edu), Chris Den Hartog (cdenhart@calpoly.edu)


1.) Who besides yourself does scheduling for your department?
- Suzy Black was the other person in the department that helped out with scheduling (joined in on the interview).


2.) Can you give us an overview of how you do scheduling? If you have any publicly accessible documents that provide information in this area, we would be happy to review those documents after the interview is over.
The overview of the current process of scheduling goes as follows: 
- Chris is given list of professors along with their selected courses by the department chair
- Chris then takes this list of professors/courses and organizes them into an excel spreadsheet 
- Often color codes the excel spreadsheet by classes (i.e. upper division, lower division, GE, miscellaneous)
- Must make sure that each faculty member meets a certain amount of teachable units (constraint)
- Susie then inputs all this information into PeopleSoft to be evaluated by University Scheduling
- Any conflict from scheduling is usually resolved by the department chair
- University scheduling has the final picks on the exact room number each professor will  be teaching in 


3.) Do you have any particular ideas for the kinds of features you would like to see in a software tool that would help you with scheduling?
- The ability for the software to integrate with PeopleSoft
- Ability to color code the classes, when displayed in calender view, by certain criteria such as upper division, lower division, masters, miscellaneous 
- Ability to easily change class rooms, size, and other features
- Be able to view/check the number of classes after a specific time
- They’re are certain time constraints for classes depending on department
- Sometimes there are professors who want to teach a class jointly (2 professors to 1 class)
- Would like to be able to view the schedules in a view similar to the “Weekly View” present in CPReg/PASS


4.) Can you think of any particular positive or negative impacts that new scheduling software might have on your department?
- Worried that the web based client will become slow/lag when too many users access it at once
- For the purposes of demoing the scheduling prototype, all users in the Liberal Arts dept. do not have Administrative rights to their laptops/desktops


6.) Can you give us an estimate of how much time after this interview you might have to review the ideas we develop to meet your requirements?
- They both expressed their interest in being involved in the review of the prototype, requirements documentation, and any other way they can help
