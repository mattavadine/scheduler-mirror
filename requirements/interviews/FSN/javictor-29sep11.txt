Interview Transcription (Jill Victorino)
Department head, 10%
Jill 90%

We received a copy of formal documentation, paper copies of the master schedule they use.
Lots of regulations by the state (scheduling time patterns, standard time units)
Department controls lab rooms with important equipment, fields, specialized stuff
food science/nutrition is mostly controlled by university

Profs email Jill to “set” their details and contraints (times, classes)
Some classes are often scheduled together (classes that are prereqs with each other, lower division along with upper division courses)
Try to keep a similar schedule between years

List of suggested features:
class conflicts (certain classes, most are taken at the same time)
schedule prereqs at the same time
seperate schedules per professor
print (historical) schedules
RPT (evaluation)
different views of t he same data!
FLAG ERRORS so that they can be fixed rapidly
validation and correction
use of previous years schedule
unifying planning system between all departments

collision criteria:
--year to year similarity
--once per year class
--class priorioty (some classes more important to have at certain times than others)

all contact goes through one person, not to many people.

jill is willing to test the software!
