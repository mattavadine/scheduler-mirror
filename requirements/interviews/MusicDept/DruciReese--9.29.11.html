<h1>Interview with Druci Reese</h1>
<h1>2:30pm September 29th, 2011</h1>

<div class=interview>
<p><b>Attendance: </b>Matthew Tondreau(308), Mike(402)</p>
<div class=question>308: Who besides you does scheduling in your department?</div>

<div class="DR">Druci Reese(DR): well Im the primary person that does the scheduling, I do it in cosultation with our chair but basically I get input from faculty in certain areas when they're trying to consolidate you know who teaches ina certain area, they share these classes over certain quarters. So they'll give me input maybe like for the upcoming year, whos gonna teach what class and then I build the schedule and develop it pretty much on historical data. We've sorta set certain classes to be scheduled consistently at certain times througout different quarters and then I provide that information to the faculty and then I go over it with our chair and It always bring to his attention things that I feel are problem areas, maybe course conflicts for major classes and things like that, but I am the primary person</div>

<div class=question>308: Can you give us an overview of your scheduling process?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Like I said its kinda old school, before we did scheduling in people soft what I did was develop a rubric sheet for every class that had all the information that I would need to build a schedule including when the consistent class times were, when we offered them, foot notes, all that kind of stuff, so that I had sorta a binder that I could go to as a reference manual. Peoplesoft you know is easier the information is in there so I use the information in dashboard and just regular peoplesoft but basically I build it kinda by hand. I've developed a grid sheet that I use for each of the faculty members so that they can visually see there schedule. Thats one of the draw backs of peoplesoft. It might show the classes but it doesnt show the time patterns, its hard to extract the information you really want. So I've developed templates that I use when Im building the schedules and it easier visually to see how all our rooms are filled and try to avoid conflicts. We're one of the few departments that we control our own rooms. I dont know if were the only department on campus but basically all our classes are in the music building. No one else can schedule things in our room. So we kinda control our own destiny so to speak. So that makes it a little easier. I know some departments they have to give them a wish list over there and they might be all over campus and we're very lucky in that respect.We obviously have to be here, with pianos and recording. But thats kinda how I do it. Sorta by hand I guess. </div>

<div class=question>308: Its obviously time consuming, what is the hardest or consumes the most time?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Probably the initial scheduling part where I sit down and block out the quarter, whatever quarter I'm working on, building it initially. Beacuse for me Im a visual person I kinda liek to see it on paper before I goto peoplesoft and go and schedule it. Because its a little bit confusing the way our classes our. We have a lot of classes that are, the same class but it has a lower division and upper division component you know like for activities and ensembles and things like that. You know when I do the first go around or initally do the schedule it usually takes me, I might devote atleast a full day to it. thats in a perfect world where I'm not constantly being interrupted. Just yesterday I was literrally working on scheduling stuff for fall, winter, and spring. Because they have these deadlines that overlap and after a while you just go 'gee ..' or somebody comes in and they say I got a problem with my schedule. And then I think its the schedule that I'm working on and no its winter not spring you know thats the kinda thing. </div>

<div class=question>308: and as you said you normally use paper, binder and people soft?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Yea, pretty much. and it works well, and the reason it works well for us is	2 reasones, first of all we spend a lot of time trying to map out consistent times for our major classes and historically those for us from quarter to quarter and from year to year. So its kinda easy and because we know we we're only in our rooms we dont have to worry about that go out there and have them put us whereever. It really makes it a lot easier in a way to do it that way. I'm sure it'd be really great to plug in a number, boom, and have it built for us but you know.</div>

<div class=question>308: Are you satisfied with it at all right now?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: satisfied with what?</div>

<div class=question>308: with your current process?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Well you know somtimes I feel, I've been doing this for a really long time, I've been doing it for like over 27 years. So you can imagine its sorta ingrained in me the way I'm doing it, I've made it worked you know. I would love to have it more streamlined or automated or there was something I could plug in the data and have it build things, but like I said I'm really visual and like to have a template I can refer to. You can go into people soft and look into certain things, it doesnt really have everything you really need to look at. You have to go to a lot of different places so for me it works but it is time consuming process. And its really hard, this is just me personally, my office is very public we have lots of interruptions lots of people coming in, students, commnity members, faculty. I dont have a place where I can go shut the door. so yknow thats my biggest sort of beef when I'm doing something like that and being constantly interrupted. For me it works well for me, when I retire and somebody  new comes in they may say 'oh my god, why is she doing it that way'</div>

<div class=question>308: Our there any features youd like to see?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: I think it would be very handy to be able to enter variables and have it give you information like theres conflicts or suggested times that might work. Because thats our biggest problem, we have the constraints of so many rooms and we dont [physically] have a whole lot of rooms. and a lot of variables and kinds of class that we have to schedule at certain spots. and sometimes its almost impossible to come up with a solution where you don't have those conflicts and we really need to try and do it. Some of it the times are ingrainged in the faculty some of its just they don't wanna teach it at other times. But it would be great to have some sort of feature that would flag and maybe give suggestions. I don't even know if thats possible.</div>

<div class=question>308: So you'd like to be able to enter constraints for only 10 classes at 10:00.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Yeah I guess, you know Idk. I'm not a real computer person. I use a computer and I feel real comfortable with it. Idk what it takes to build these things but for me it would be great for example like when we put all the stuff in people soft it'd be niec to be able to export that into a template where you could visually see the schedule and it had all the information you needed. It didnt just say this is joe smiths fall schedule and these are the classes he teaches, but it doesnt have the room locations or the tiems or things like that, thats one of the drawbacks of peoplesoft you have to go to different spots to find all the information for that class like if you want to see what the prerequisites are for a class you have to go some place its not all contained in one area so your constantly toggling back and forth so it'd be nice to be able to input the information sorta like in dashboard. I mean Im assuming your familiar with all that, the stuff that we use.</div>

<div class=question>308: yeah to some degree</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Some thigns you can like export down to excel, it'd be great if there were templates once you entered that information, they have templates that you can download maybe by classroom or faculty name for a particular quarter cuz what I've done I sorta reinvented, I enter it into peoplesoft and I've made these templates so I've gotta enter it every quarter and its really nice when its done but it is time consuming.</div>

<div class=question>308: So you'd like all the clerical work done for you?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Yeah, yeah. that'd be nice. I'll make myself obsolete.</div>

<div class=question>308: Speaking about that, are there any concerns about the scheduling job being taken over by software?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: You know in our department I'd still have to be involved in it, like I said because we control our own rooms thats the primary thing. You know Im not really worried about that. Plus I've been here a really long time and I'm probably gonna be retiring. Honestly I'm not worried about my job being obsolete and also I have a lot of other responsibilites in addition to scheduling, even if that went away I'd have more then enough to keep me busy all day. So no I'm not really worried. I can't imagine they'd centralize that and take that scheduling stuff from departments</div>

<div class=question>308: are there any other negative or positive things you'd be worried about? Like errors occuring?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: I'd have to say no not really, the people in the scheduling office here, They're really great. They're super fantastic and super helpful and like just yesterday I was having trouble entering data and it wasn't accepting it and I knew everything was correct and I called them sorta see what I was seeing and I of course I kinda ending up re-entering it. But thats a great resource for the campus. SO thats a plus for me at least.</div>

<div class=question>308: Is there anyone in your department thats had unsatisfactory with software or scheduling software?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: I dont think so, no. Most of our faculty are minimally proficient in peoplesoft and whats available for viewing, some more then others can go in and look and see there schedule and all that kinda stuff. But for the most  part they dont use it a whole lot I think.</div>

<div class=question>308: Do you think they'd be interested in or be able to enter there own preferences online through the software, you think they'd be able to manage that?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: You mean instead of me doing it?</div>

<div class=question>308: Yeah.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Oh, I dont think we'd ever allow that honestly, You'd run into some territorial issues because we do have certain classrooms that certain faculty kinda feel ownership over. I can't see that ever happening. The only thing I could see possibly is a way for them to communicate there preferences to me but like I said we try to maintain a consistency for when our classes are taught for the most part we have to balance the academic, the lecture classes, with the perfromance classes and we have to be consistent. Because the constituency is not just majors, theres students from every major on campus and so in order to maintain the levels of enrollment in those classes we have to have a consistency of times for our performing ensemble and so I cant see really that being an option</div>

<div class=question>308: So is there anything else youd really like to see?</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Not really other then what I've already said. I'm not quite clear what your project is, is this the goal, try to develope we as users would use as campus scheduling and things like that?</div>

<div class=question>402: Yeah, um basically we're looking at something where you'd fill in the whole database with rooms, professors, classes and one thing we have incorporated is professor preferences, when they wanna teach what classes they wanna teach and also you'd be able to input 'ok we cant have this class going on at the same time as this class' certain constraints and essential yeah we wanna make an algorithm that will generate a schedule for you.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Even if that was put in place, theres no gurantee that that would be what we want our finished schedule to be. right?</div>

<div class=question>308: Right, of course there would be editing.</div>

<div class=question>402: You definetly have the choice to edit whatever schedule was spit out or maybe it would spit out multiple schedules and you could choose between them.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: I think that would be great I mean honestly like I said I feel like im entering data but then I still have todo the manual but it'd be nice to sorta merge those 2 so that your entering the data and export it out into a visual thing rather then looking at a computer screen, because you know that isnt always an option. Yeah I think its a good thing I've been asking for years 'isnt there a scheduling thing software thing you guys can provide us with although I think our department is a little unique because we get to schedule all our rooms and we've made it work, but every quarter theres always an issue of overlapping classes and how to deal with that and its hard.</div>

<div class=question>308: So you guys definetly need like say certain rooms are for a chamber orchestra or choir or whatever? So constraints for specific rooms not just auto-generate random rooms for you.	</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Right, for example we have 5 rooms we schedule in. 2 downstair classrooms which are like 27 capacity and then we have a keyboard lab which we have elctronic keyboards in there and the room capacitys only 14 cuz thats how many stations we have and occasionally if scheduling is really tight in the other rooms we might, we do schedule some small lecture classes in there like a music theory kinda class and then we have our 2 rooms upstairs, our large choir room which we use for our big ge class so thats kinda a multi-purpose room, and then we sorta have our instrumental ensemble which is almost exclusively used for instrumental ensemble. So thats kinda how they all work out. And we're bursting at the seems. We have alot of things that are TBA for example lessons. Every music major gets music lessons and thats a class they register for and those are all TBA in the schedule so we have to manually. Because those schedules are set at the beginning of every quarter and they're contingent on the student schedule and the availablility of the teacher. So those get set every quarter and we have to find space, sometimes its in a classroom, sometimes its in an office like this, a faculty office, sometimes its in a practice room, and those are rooms that are not in the grid. Faculty offices are not in the rubric for scheduling nor are the practice rooms. We do all those internally and we have similarly a lot of instrumental ensembles that are TBA because they can't schedule a time for the students, its a small ensemble and until they get there schedule of when there other classes are then they figure out when all maybe 5 of them can meet so those are always TBA so again those are like internal scheduling issues that we do, so that adds a wrinkle and it falls outside the they're in the schedule but theyre not slotted into a classroom. But after the fact we kinda do it internally. So that makes it a little more problematic.</div>

<div class=question>308: Is there anythign else you'd like to add.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Nope</div>

<div class=question>308: can you give us an estimate of how much time you'd be avaiable in the future to maybe review some of our progress we've made in this fall quarter.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Well idk you mean like</div>

<div class=question>308: Well like if we deploy something like look at it and play around with it, or even follow up on our design specifications.</div>

<div class="DR">DR: I dont know, I'd definetly be available it kinda depends on when in the quarter, like Im gonna be gone.</div>

<div class=question>308: well were looking at weeks 3,7 and 10 ideally</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Well I dont have a calendar so I can't say when those are. Week 3 is i think</div>
	
<div class=question>402: It'd be next week</div>

<div class="DR">DR: Next week is out, I'm gonna be gone for 2 weeks after that so Im cramming stuff in next week. So I'll probably be available later in the quarter. As long as you dont email me the day before, absolutely I can make it work</div>

<div class=question>308: That about wraps it up.</div>
