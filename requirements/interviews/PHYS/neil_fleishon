Interview w/ Neil Fleishon

- Clarified what program is going to do
- He's the sole scheduler for his department
- Been doing this since 1989
- Just uses a tabular interface right now
- Process
   - Open up PeopleSoft
   - Take previous year's schedule and change's upper-division courses
      - Swap every-other quarter classes
   - Lower division courses pretty much stay the same
   - Uses "FileMaker"
      - Mac-specific software
      - Custom scripts help to make his job easier
   - Directly inputs into PeopleSoft
   - By first phase, he usually has classes and times
   - Second phase
      - Univsersity sends out request for scheduer to alter his first phase 
        schedule
        (Done b/c you don't know what instructors are going to be around until
         around second phase)
   - Would rather not put instructors into the Schedule
      - Just make 'em all STAFF
   - Figure out how many classes to you're going to need
      - Hires instructors on an as-needed basis (esp. for the Fall)
      - Sometimes hires quarter-to-quarter
   - Assign instructors to classes, rather than classes to instructors
   - Anybody should/could be able to teach a course
      - Upper division stuff is different
         - That's only 20% of their scheduling stuff
- Most time-consuming thing is entering into PeopleSoft
   - Would be nice if there was an easier interface to automate data entry
      - Like Christy wanted for CSC
   - Changing data in PeopleSoft is very time consuming
   - Feels like double-entry
   - PeopleSoft is bulky
- Old system: SiS (Student Information Systems)
   - No internet back then. Everything communicated through physical mediums
   - Sold schedule books in the bookstore
   - Signed up at tables in buildings of phoning in to get their schedules

- Useful software features
   - Interface where you can drop individual schedules
   - Be able to "block out" chunks of time
   - Rate time periods (like "am" higher/lower priority then "pm")
      - 1 vs 1.5 hour lectures
      - Lectures vs. labs
      - Separated lab/lec or back-to-back
      - Only looks for these things if there's wiggle room, as he's too busy 
        already
   - Preference scale
   - Push a button! : D
      - Looking for the one-button, optimal solution
      - Helps to remove scheduler's from the "blame" of "unfair" schedules
         - That'll put more responsibility on us, the programmer
   - "Flip" two faculty schedules
   - GUI w/ calendar in front
      - Drag courses onto the calendar and they pop on the schedule
   - No room-time conflicts 
      - No double-booked rooms and no double-booked instructors
   - Keep track of workload for instructors (WTU's)
   - Integrating office hours
   - Interface to easily read/view schedule information in various sorted forms
   
- Constraints
   - "Chaining" or "associations"
      - Certain labs go w/ certain lectures
      - MWF or TR lectures
         - A MWF lecture would have a T or R lab
      - Try to put labs between successive lectures

- Pros/Cons to software
   - Would make his life easier
   - If it's not easy to learn, we haven't done our job

- Has website where people can see previously generated schedules
      
- Willing to learn small language to create custom constraints particular to his
  department
   - Might lose other schedulers, though, b/c not as many of them know how to 
     program as much as he does
      - Not as many "power users"
- Include as many customizable features as possible
      
- Willing to meet later on in the quarter    
      
- Program exists to extract data from PeopleSoft and display data into a more
  cohesive form
   - Some computer tech guy
   - Website
   - Queries PeopleSoft constantly for last, current, and next schedule info
      - Everything scheduler's have submitted
   - Lists courses in a very readable 

- Spring quarter needs to be done next week
