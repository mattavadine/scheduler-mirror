<br>
<strong>Part 1</strong>
Department wants different instructor preferences for different quarters.
Department wants to be able to override preferences; assigning a certain professor to a certain course.
<br>
<strong>Part 2</strong>
Department wants the program to keep a log of any schedule changes made.
Department doubts that a computer screen can contain a comprehendable view of their entire schedule.  Math department has over 100 courses every quarter, they use their big grid board as a visual (see image).
<br>
<strong>Part 3</strong>
They couldn't really see the value in having the Calendar Schedule view (around 30 min mark) because they're department is so big. Might be useful for
other departments. Try to make Calendar view more doable for math department. They like the other view (The course view with instructors shown per course). 
Have Scheduler be directly connected to Peoplesoft. They want to be able to do it all on the Scheduler and just hit "submit" and it gets sent to scheduling
so the department doesn't have to actually turn in a hard copy. 
Be able to "set conflicts" so that certain classes aren't taught at the same time in case students need to take both in the same quarter. 
They definitely see themselves using this product for scheduling.
