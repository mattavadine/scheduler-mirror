=== General Operation ===
When a schedule is created, it is in “working” mode. Once it is complete, it may become “proposed”. Any quarter can have any number of “working” or “proposed” schedules. Only one schedule can be considered “committed” as the official schedule for that quarter. A committed schedule is still easily edited, or swapped out with another proposed schedule. Individual instructors are able to view the committed schedule, and possible the proposed (?). A link is present that sends an immediate feedback e-mail to the registered schedule administrator.
When editing a schedule via drag-n-drop, the calendar view greys out when dragging a selected class. Only areas that do not create a conflict are available to drop. Areas that create a ‘light’ conflict (non-essential or resolvable) are grey, but placeable. Areas that create a ‘hard’ conflict (instructor, time, room) are dark grey and not placeable.
