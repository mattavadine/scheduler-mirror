<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<p>1. Just Kathleen that does the scheduling.  Gets preliminary one from the Chair.
</p>
<p>2. Kathleen gets the the initial handwritten mock-up schedule.  She then creates the real schedule in Google Docs.  After she finalizes it gets sent back and forth between scheduling and the dept.  Two weeks before hand, Kathleen sends out a preferences sheet to all the faculty.  She likes being able to sort on Classes, Instructor, Days on the view for all the classes for the quarter.  Kathleen usually goes through multiple schedule iterations before she gets one to pass.  Instructors are allowed to have different preferences based on years worked / contracts.
</p> 
<p>3. Ability to search and sort is very important.  Each class entry in the schedule should have a comments section.  Kathleen uses this field for notes for herself to keep track of different attributes of the class.  Kathleen prefers to see everything in a list rather than a calendar view.  Lists can be sorted.  Prints out the schedule in class order and instructor order.  Ability to pull data from previous quarter.  Entering all the data from the schedule into Peoplesoft is very time consuming. 
</p>
<p>4. Positive - Not worried about it taking less time.  Current process takes 50% of her time.  Still doing room change requests for fall.
</p>
<p>5. Nothing really to add.</p>
<p>6. Would be willing to spend time during weeks 4, 7, 10.
