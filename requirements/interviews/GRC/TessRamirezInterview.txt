(interview with Tess Ramirez)

They have a committee that is comprised of faculty. usually the same ones:
- prof bill loving bloving@calpoly.edu
- brady teufel bteufel@calpoly.edu
- richard gearheart rgearhar@calpoly.edu
all falculty.

they can request university space, so room conflicts are not a problem. they only have two dedicated rooms.

they are NOT satisfied with the scheduling process

she doesnt have a simple schedule that she can just print up and give to faculty. a nice matrix. she wants printable. wants an option for one teacher only, also an option for all the teachers on one paper.

she wants to know if shes entering a time thats not a time pattern (such as MWF 9-10).

she doesnt like how so much data entry is required, cuz its error prone

professors can look, not touch

she only wants binary preferences, like someone CANNOT work at that time.

NO other preferences, because of political reasons.

she uses excel right now. a few different matrixes. one room centric, one instructor centric

in two weeks, we will email her to schedule another meeting
