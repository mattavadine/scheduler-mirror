<strong>CSC 402: Feature Prioritization Matrix</strong>
</p>
</font>
<p>
The features included in a prioritization matrix are the discriminated union of
features we deem to be particularly important, plus all of the tool features
gathered in the interviews.  The structure of this matrix is very similar to
the feature comparison matrix described in the 308 document here:
<blockquote><pre>
<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/handouts/feature-matrix.html">
http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308/handouts/feature-matrix.html
</a>
</pre></blockquote>
</p><p>
The rows in the prioritization matrix are elements of a taxonomic feature list,
with precisely the same structure as in the comparison matrix.  Each column in
the prioritization matrix corresponds to a requirements interview, with one or
more interview attendees.
</p><p>
Each matrix cell has an integer "desirability value" from -2 to 2, defined as
follows:
</p><p>
<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Value</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Meaning</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>-2
    <td valign=top>Really don't want the feature
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>-1
    <td valign=top>Would rather not have the feature
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>0
    <td valign=top>Don't care about the feature
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>1
    <td valign=top>Would like to have the feature
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2
    <td valign=top>Really want the feature
</table>
</p><p>
Insert your features and scores in the table below:
<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>DEPT</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Feature</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Score</strong>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>EX
    <td valign=top>Matrix completion
    <td valign=top>2
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
    <td valign=top>
    <td valign=top>
</table>
