<p>At the beginning, all courses will be listed under the left side list which counts as courses that the instructor is unable to teach. The next step is for the user to drag all the courses that they can teach to the five different preference levels on the right.</p> 
<p>Descriptions of the different preference levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Strong Interest:</b> I am highly qualified and would really like to teach.</li>
<li><b>Preferred:</b> I am qualified and would like to teach.</li>
<li><b>Acceptable:</b> This is not a priority course, but I am qualified and would not mind teaching.</li>
<li><b>Not Preferred:</b> It would put strain on me, but I could teach if necessary.</li>
<li><b>Strong Disinterest:</b> I would need to make special arrangements to teach this course, but could if absolutely necessary.</li>
<li><b>Not qualified:</b> There is absolutely no way I can teach this course</li>
</ol>
