<!--Body of the page's text-->
<p>
The Scheduler Tool is designed to accomodate three types of users: scheduler administrators, faculty, and students. In the following subsections, details are given regarding the UI by which each type of user will utilize the scheduling tool.<br>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the user type, the Scheduler Tool displays a "splash screen" upon execution, presenting the user with options pertaining to their user group. This screen can be bypassed permanently by checking the appropriate box in the screen. Beyond the splash screen, the user's most recently opened/viewed/edited schedule is displayed by default. If the user has yet to open a schedule in previous sessions, a blank window is displayed.<br>
