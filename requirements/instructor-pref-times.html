<p>At the beginning, the week view will be blank indicating a neutral preference for all possible instruction hours. The two text entry boxes allow the user to enter the beginning and ending time of the block they wish to add. The Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, and Fri checkboxes specify which days of the week for which the block will be added. To the right, above the Add and Delete buttons is a slider that allows you to choose a preference level from the choices listed below.</p>
<p>Descriptions of the different preference levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><b><font color=green>Preferred:</font></b> If there are no other constraints, these are the hours I would like to teach. Will appear as green.</li>
<li><b><font color=yellow>Acceptable:</font></b> Courses scheduled any time in this range are acceptable. Will appear as yellow.</li>
<li><b><font color=orange>Not Preferred:</font></b> I would require special arrangements due to previous commitments. I can do this only if absolutely necessary. Will appear as orange.</li>
<li><b><font color=red>Unavailable:</font></b> There is absolutely no way I can teach during these periods. Will appear as red.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the user is done using the available adjustments to add a chunk of time, they can then click on the Add button. Chunks of time added will appear on the week view with the respective color listed above. For deletion of chunks of time, the user may click on the chunk and then click on Delete.</p>
